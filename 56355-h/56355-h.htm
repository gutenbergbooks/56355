<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br />
A SERENADE IN THE MOONLIGHT
</h3>

<p>
"Fairer art thou than the lily, than the rose more
sweet," sang a mellow baritone voice.  A guitar
thrummed accompaniment.  At the end of his
improvisation the singer waved the instrument gracefully,
now in sweeping stroke, again in shorter measure, as
if he were a maestro directing his musicians.  Then
he touched the strings in melancholy strain:
</p>

<p>
"Beat, beat, little dove, thy tender wings against thy
iron cage."
</p>

<p>
Next triumphantly he intoned:
</p>

<p>
"Fly away, little dove, fly away; the cruel bars are
broken."
</p>

<p>
Once more in pantomime he directed his fancied
musicians.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Don Alfredo?  Art fanning thyself, or
do mosquitoes annoy thee?"
</p>

<p>
He looked upward into a pair of dark, laughing eyes
not three feet distant.
</p>

<p>
"O, Doña Carmelita," rapturously, "I was marking
rhythm for the angel choirs which sing in praise of thy
beauty and charm.  They sing of one angel, even thou,
Doña mia, more fair than they."
</p>

<p>
The girl withdrew from the embrasure, brushing her
fan across its iron-barred front.
</p>

<p>
"I shut out, Don Alfredo, thy foolish words.  I drive
them back into the air.  I fear the angels are displeased
at thy presumption.  Many nights have you sung here
meaningless words, empty nothings; but even better
such than to speak thoughts which must offend the
saints in heaven."
</p>

<p>
"O, Doña Carmelita, let me once again see thy eyes
sparkle in the moonlight; add a flash or two from thy
teeth of pearl&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Don Alfredo, or I leave.  Perhaps at other
embrasures not far away wait caballeros, not so vain
as to fancy themselves directors of the music celestial.
Good night, Don Alfredo.  Clip the wings of thy
imagination lest thou fly too near the sun."
</p>

<p>
"O, Doña mia, do not go away.  If it please thee I'll
praise the heavenly angels."
</p>

<p>
The window was suddenly closed.
</p>

<p>
"Caramba! again.  It's difficult for a soldier to trim
his tongue that he may speak words of love to the tender
ears of the capricious señorita."
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Captain Morando."
</p>

<p>
The soldier turned abruptly.  At his side stood
Señor Mendoza, administrator of the Mission of San
José, gravely looking at him.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, your Excellency.  I hope your health
is all of the best," somewhat discomposedly.
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks, Captain.  Your hope is generously
fulfilled in me, for my health is indeed good."
</p>

<p>
The Administrator's expression became quizzical.
"May I ask you, brave soldier, why you stand on guard
here in the moonlight, bearing that singular-appearing
firearm?" pointing to the guitar.  "Can it be that
renegade Indians threaten?"
</p>

<p>
"When a soldier stands at guard, Señor Administrator,
may there not be motives many, other than
renegade Indians?"
</p>

<p>
The other laughed and changed the subject.  "Did
I but dream the comandante of the pueblo of San José
was to be here to-night, he would have been invited to
sit with our council meeting but now concluded.  Spring
advances, and the rains fall not.  Never has Alta
California seen such drought.  Our live stock sadly need
grazing and water.  Hence I called the council.  I
would that you had been present.  The military mind
is fertile in expedient."
</p>

<p>
"I fear it would be sadly deficient in surmounting the
need of a south wind."
</p>

<p>
"Our Captain has wit, as well as vigilance.  But I
am forgetting hospitality, soldier protector of the
Mission.  Come within.  Let others woo, if they will,
the goddess of dreams, but for you and me the pleasures
of fellowship will hasten lagging hours."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, Señor Mendoza, but I fear&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fear never a moment, friend Morando.  Sentinels
watch over us in valley and on hill, men trusty, tried,
and true.  Eyes have they as keen as eagles; the ears
and the swiftness of the fox are theirs.  Therefore no
vigil need thou keep for us."
</p>

<p>
Morando still hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Come now.  Right glad am I that you are here.
Within, a glass of wine, a chat, perhaps a harmless game
at cards, await us.  Soon roll the hours away.  Then
you gallop across the pastures, alas! dry and bare now,
to the pueblo of San José.  I seek my couch soothed
by your young companionship.  Now, what wilt thou?"
</p>

<p>
An inarticulate sound behind the embrasure.  Don
Alfredo could have sworn it concealed a silvery laugh
from the fair Doña Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"The night birds are calling, Don Alfredo.  Did
you not just hear them?" looking slyly at the captain.
"They are sleepy and we arouse them."
</p>

<p>
Holding his arm and talking the while about the
drought and other difficulties the Administrator led
Don Alfredo within.
</p>

<p>
"Brave Captain, place that death-dealing weapon on
the chair," pointing a second time to the guitar.  "Some
new invention, of course, though I seem to see something
familiar about it.  Seat yourself on that settee.
It came to me from Madrid."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, señor."
</p>

<p>
With a smile as gracious as the moonlight the señor
said: "At another time I would ask my daughter, the
Doña Carmelita, to join us for a little visit, but the
child is young and the night already late.  She would
doubtless wish to sleep."
</p>

<p>
They were in the Administrator's private sitting
room, the duplicate of a room in his father's castle in
Spain.  Priceless Persian rugs were on the floor, with
high-back chairs of solid mahogany everywhere about.
A massive secretary, likewise of mahogany, stood at one
side.  Tapestries designed in Seville hung on one of the
walls; weapons of the hunt and of war, another; while
oil paintings of battles, in many of which the family
Mendoza had been distinguished, completed the adornment.
</p>

<p>
"Caramba!  I ride miles to serenade the daughter;
and here I am in the hacienda house, the guest of the
father, while the señorita is somewhere in the courtyard,
laughing, I'm sure&mdash;yes, laughing," thought the young
soldier.
</p>

<p>
"Some wine, my Captain?  Genuine Malaga it is,
guaranteed by government stamp, not the juice of the
old Mission grape, excellent as that is.  Now, the
cigarros.  Let us speak, Señor Captain, of the General
Guerrero.  I understand he was once commander of that
division in Spain from which you have so lately come.
Am I correct?"
</p>

<p>
"You are, señor.  The General was my commander so
recently that one year will more than bridge the time."
</p>

<p>
"Guerrero was my captain when, as a subaltern, I
sailed these western seas, and saw service in the
Philippines&mdash;service that was service.  Tell me of my
one-time leader.  Is he well?"
</p>

<p>
"He is well, and the years have small meaning to his
strength."
</p>

<p>
Captain Morando talked with his host of the campaigns
of General Guerrero in the Spanish trans-Mediterranean
dependencies; of the newly concluded peace
there; and of the retirement of the General by the age
limit, but all the while his mind was fashioning love
songs outside the window of the fair señorita.  Through
the haze of tobacco smoke the strong, kindly face of
the Administrator of Mission San José de Guadalupe
softened into the sweet face of the doña, with her
laughing eyes and beautiful hair; his deep voice gave way to
the lighter tones of the daughter.
</p>

<p>
"Peace in North Africa brought relief to the young
soldier from discomforts of the campaign.  Was it not
so?"
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza, it brought the weariness of camp
and garrison.  The morning drill, the after-luncheon
parade, the society function in the evening, ill filled my
idea of the life a man should live.  Besides, the
ambitious soldier sees advancement only in a life of action.
I sought a change and I found one.  My resignation
was easily effected.  I then carried my letters to the
Mexican war secretary, whom I made acquainted with
my preference.  Accordingly, came my assignment to
San José pueblo."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Good, my Captain!  During my visit in
Mexico just concluded I learned that you had been
appointed comandante.  Some wine in your glass?"
</p>

<p>
"No more, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"What, not any?  The young man is abstemious.
That is well.  Strong and lusty age follows youth lived
along the way of moderation."
</p>

<p>
The men puffed their cigars.  Higher and higher, in
widening circles, rose the incense of the fragrant leaf.
The Administrator was busy with his thoughts;
likewise the guest.  "His daughter, he intimates, is too
young for late hours.  Many a night, at low twelve,
during his sojourn in Mexico, have I sung to her from
my corner in the courtyard.  What would he say if he
knew that to-night is not my first visit thither&mdash;nor
yet my second&mdash;nor my third&mdash;nor yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The older man broke the silence.  "Soldier, our
California needs men."
</p>

<p>
Morando started slightly, then signified by a
movement of the head that he had heard.  Mendoza exhaled
several whiffs of his Havana before speaking further,
meanwhile surveying the alert form and soldierly
features of the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Life is not all play, as many appear to think it is.
Our province has passed the years of childhood.  With
maturity comes duty as waking with day."
</p>

<p>
The soldier listened with interest.
</p>

<p>
"I believe the cleavage of California and Mexico is
near at hand.  They fall apart by their own weight.
Even the Mexican secretary of state spoke openly of
this to me a month ago."
</p>

<p>
"Then what comes, Señor Mendoza?"
</p>

<p>
"There comes that which we ourselves make.  On an
ethical foundation of the highest order must we build
our body politic.  Then, when our province becomes free,
some protecting nation will extend to us a sister's hand.
If in this fruitful land there should prevail the spirit
of sweet-do-nothingness, how can we hope that others
will consider us highly while we deem ourselves lightly?"
</p>

<p>
"My time here has been too short to have studied
these matters carefully.  However, I have heard men
speak of a California republic."
</p>

<p>
"The vision of dreamers, my Captain.  We have
neither army nor navy, nor can we hope to have them.
How could we unaided hold this province situated as
it is, the commercial center of these seas and the bosom
of resources as yet scarcely touched?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, in your judgment, it should not be a question
of absolute independence?"
</p>

<p>
"In one sense, no.  Yet, I favor a rule by the people.
People of enlightenment will govern wisely.  Captain
Morando, we need men, more men, who will place the
common good above their private interest."
</p>

<p>
"You speak the duty of the soldier, Señor Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"It is so, Captain."  Then turning the conversation
back to the situation in the Santa Clara valley: "Have
you run across Stanislaus yet?  No?  Nor Yoscolo?
Well, I hope you will soon see both over your pistol
barrel.  They are a menace to the peace in our valley.
Yoscolo is the abler of the two.  Many a lively skirmish
have my fighting peons had with the scoundrel."
</p>

<p>
During this time the Doña Carmelita mounted a staircase
and walked along a passage which had its way over
a high, wide adobe wall leading from one part of the
house to another.  The moonlight fell in weird fantasy
on the hacienda grounds.  Palms, evergreens, flowers
assumed moving shapes, as if engaged in low but
animated conversation.
</p>

<p>
Breezes from San Francisco Bay flowed intermittently
into the courtyard, shaking the branches and
rattling the leaves.  One stronger gust caught spray
from a fountain and sent it eddying into the white
night.  The awakened birds murmured sleepily and
myriad crickets chirped remonstrance.  Three Spanish
mastiffs, guardians of the inclosure, edged away from
the impromptu shower, then looked up furtively at the
girl, ashamed of temporary cowardice.
</p>

<p>
Anon there floated down to her from the heights beyond
the call of the Indian sentinel as he made his rounds,
"Love to God!" followed by the reply from one of his
fellows, "Love to God!"  With a dozen tongues the
hills took up the refrain, "Love to God!  Love to God!"
</p>

<p>
"What can my father and Captain Morando find to
talk about so long!  Men can gossip as well as women
when they are so minded."
</p>

<p>
She mounted another flight of outside stairs that
led to the top of the buildings which formed three sides
of the courtyard.  The courtyard door was open.  Several
peons were holding the struggling watchdog while
another brought Morando's horse.
</p>

<p>
"Hold fast those dogs!" Señor Mendoza said to the
Indians.  "They are as fierce as tigers.  Good-night,
Captain Morando.  Remember two weeks from Thursday
evening, at six.  My daughter's dueña will be home
from Monterey, and we'll have both to dine with us,
with perhaps a few friends, just a valecito casero&mdash;a
little house party.  Good-night.  Glad you've some
men in the village.  The country won't be safe till we
rid it of those miscreant renegades.  Good-night, Captain."
</p>

<p>
The heavy door closed.  The doña saw that Captain
Morando rode around the courtyard to the embrasure
window, halted and looked up anxiously.  Walking to
the edge of the roof she stood there, a beautiful picture.
He waved his hand.
</p>

<p>
"O, doña mia&mdash;" he began.  Unfastening a rose from
her hair she tossed it to him.  The pulsing air caught
it, and swaying, whirling, it fell.  He reined in his horse,
urged it forward, swung it around, keeping in the
uncertain downward path of the rose, till finally its stem
rested in his hand.
</p>

<p>
He kissed the flower again and again; then holding it
up to her, waved it in rhythmic motion as he had done
before with the guitar.
</p>

<p>
"O, doña mia&mdash;" he began once more, but the
watchdogs bayed savagely and rushed against the adobe
fence.  His horse shied and sprang away.  He wheeled
back again.
</p>

<p>
The señorita had disappeared.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br />
THE LION AND THE LAMB LIE DOWN TOGETHER
</h3>

<p>
Most unwonted drought had laid a withering hand
on fertile Santa Clara valley that year.  March
had come and no vast stretches of wild oats measured
the way from foothill to bay; no juicy grazing for
cattle and horses on the rich bottom lands.  The
plain-brown color-tone of autumn prevailed, not that of
spring, in triumphant green and promise of rich harvest.
</p>

<p>
This interchange prevailed almost everywhere except
around the gushing springs at the Mission San José.
Here rioted nature in her proudest fancy, for the
intense warmth of day and night had brought to blossom
before their time wild plant, oleander, and fruit tree.
Here was green grass in luxuriant abundance, while
the tall mustard flaunted its yellow top as usual, and
afforded a resting place for chattering blackbird and
twittering linnet.
</p>

<p>
The springs on the Administrator's property several
miles north of Mission San José had gradually
diminished in flow until only unsightly, trampled mud
remained where was a limpid lake in happier years.
</p>

<p>
The geyserlike warm springs on the property of Don
Fulgencio Higuera, Señor Mendoza's neighbor to the
south, had suddenly run dry.  In fact, not more than
half a dozen sources of water-supply remained within
a radius of a score of miles.  The like had never been
known, not even in the memory of the oldest Indian in
the valley.
</p>

<p>
Weird relics of Druidic worship, half forgotten under
the tutelage of the Mission padres, were revived in
forest and mountain.  Vast columns of smoke, odoriferous
of cedar and bay-leaf, reached high toward heaven in
the motionless air.  The ancient name of Oroysom
replaced on many a tongue that of the smoothly flowing
Mission San José de Guadalupe, which name the
missionaries had given the region when their work of
Christianizing the Indians began.
</p>

<p>
"Oroysom, Oroysom, begs thee, Great Spirit, to
awake," sang the aborigine.  "Let the perfume of laurel
propitiate thee.  Let the sweetness of the smoke of
cedar be a gracious offering unto thee.  On the fields
of Oroysom no food for beast is found.  Gaunt famine
is rushing hither in wind-swift pace.  Our hunters
search stream and wildwood, but find no food for the
child, the women, the old people.  There is no maize,
no field of growing wheat; and, lo! the garden is dry
and empty.  Oroysom calls on thee, Father of the rain,
Source of the springs, and Giver of the harvest, to
arouse from slumber and forget no longer the people
who from old have honored thee."
</p>

<p>
Around the great fires at night the Indians swung
hand in hand, swaying in willowy motion as they
chanted their incantation.  Their shadows danced in
wildest abandon on the mammoth rocks or mountain
peaks which formed the background of the strange
scene.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza, the leading spirit among the landholders
on the eastern side of the valley, endeavored, as,
indeed, did his neighbors, to maintain equanimity, but
there was much anxiety among all.
</p>

<p>
Even water for family use had to be carried on
horseback, the vaqueros from ranchos miles away coming
to the few remaining water-supplies, and riding back
with the precious water skins over the pommel of the
saddle.
</p>

<p>
It was the last week of January when the Administrator
first called his fellow landowners together to
consider what could be done.  They gathered in his sitting
room.  Graybeards they were, the most of them, and
rich in the wisdom of many years, as well as in landed
possessions.
</p>

<p>
Long they smoked the cigarros of the provident
Administrator and sipped his rare wines, the while
exchanging polite remarks on the nothings of the day.
This was their way while waiting to begin attack on
some weighty subject.  Finally Señor Mendoza ordered
the serving peons to bring on his choicest cognac, a
select French product.
</p>

<p>
"The Administrator is vastly disturbed over this
rainless winter," whispered Don Pedro Zelaya, of the
rancho San Lorenzo, to Don Fulgencio Higuera, of the
rancho Aguas Calientes.  "Paris knows no better cognac
than I see here.  I divine his anxiety by the quality
of his liquors.  Last year when renegade Indians
threatened he furnished our meeting here with a Portuguese
cordial mild as milk.  Much as he fears the prowling
Yoscolo and Stanislaus, he measures them not high in
comparison with this drought."
</p>

<p>
The leonine-appearing Señor Higuera squared his
yard-wide shoulders to attention as he sat in his
high-backed chair.  His eye ran slowly over the slender and
dapper Señor Zelaya.  A trace of humor stole into his
eyes, then over his bearded face.  "Brandy in the head
seldom lends swiftness to the feet.  Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
Pedro Zelaya was the swiftest foot-racer in the
province of California.  He was also a lover of good
eating and drinking.  When training for his famous
races he must forego the delicacies of his French cook,
and the bouquet of imported wine, which deprivations
he relished not over well.
</p>

<p>
"A thimbleful of brandy is given even to a bull-fighter
before the contest," replied Señor Zelaya, bowing
politely and suavely smiling.
</p>

<p>
Years before the doughty Señor Higuera had seized
and held by the horns an infuriated bull which,
maddened by eating the dreaded rattleweed, a venomous
plant then common, had left the herd and rushed up on
Higuera, who was standing, with his wife and children,
in the open before the courtyard of his hacienda house.
</p>

<p>
The peons served the cognac in long, slender-stemmed
goblets.  Señor Mendoza raised his glass, looked for a
moment at the amber liquid, then sipped it gently.
Lowering the glass he glanced around at the assembled
company.  Each man, following the example of the
host, tasted the contents of his own glass, and then
allowed his eyes to rest on the Señor Administrator.
</p>

<p>
This process was repeated once, twice, three times,
until each had finished his beverage.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza's aquiline features, garnished by
mustache and imperial, and embellished by a waving
iron-gray hair, fell into severer mold.
</p>

<p>
"Señors, my friends, may I have your attention?"
</p>

<p>
No one spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Señors," his tones serious and resonant, "it is not
raining to-day."
</p>

<p>
His assertion was not disputed.  The rays of the sun
streamed into the room.  It was afternoon and the
delicately tinted stained glass of the windows was
resplendent in the light.
</p>

<p>
"It rained not yesterday, nor in the yesterday of
many months," looking from one to another of his
company, as if in search of opposition.
</p>

<p>
The señors, in solemn concord, bowed in corroboration
of his statement.
</p>

<p>
"The soft south wind blows not.  Overhead is the
summer sun.  I see no hope of rain to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
The grave señors acquiesced.
</p>

<p>
"Indians in thousands, beasts in tens of thousands,
are on our lands.  Responsibilities, neither few nor
doubtful, weigh on our shoulders.  If it rains not
to-morrow, nor yet till the to-morrows touch late spring,
how can we fulfill the duty this province of Alta
California lays at our door, that our aborigine wards lack
not the sustenance their condition demands?"
</p>

<p>
His look went from face to face.  Suddenly he stood
upright.
</p>

<p>
"Señors, to save our people we must save our cattle.
Even if the rain comes, the feed will be late.  Therefore
our herds must go elsewhere soon, or only their dried
bones will see another year.  Whither shall we take
them?"
</p>

<p>
The foremost in the council gave their views.
</p>

<p>
"The river to the north, called Russian, nourishes
vast cañons of redwood forest.  The soil is ever moist
where the heaven-searching redwood grows.  Let rafts
be made to ferry the animals to the shore of Contra
Costa.  In another year they will return, with increase,
fat and safe.  Our peons throughout the year can call
hither from that region the supplies we need."  Thus
Don Antonio Peralta.
</p>

<p>
As he concluded the other leaders bowed to him
solemnly.
</p>

<p>
The dapper Zelaya indicated to his host, who was yet
standing, his wish to speak.
</p>

<p>
The quiet humor in the heart of Señor Higuera stole
again into his eyes and over his face and reached
his tongue.  "Swiftness in the feet means quickness in
the mind directing those feet.  Let us hear Señor
Zelaya."
</p>

<p>
The lord of the rancho San Lorenzo looked musingly
at his friend.  "I doubt greatly that even Señor Higuera
could hold a grizzly bear by the horns, since that
creature possesses none.  At any rate, the grizzly has
strength yet greater than our mighty Higuera here.
The deep shadows of the Russian river cañons shelter
these enemies in numbers.  Our vaqueros could little
protect their charges in those glades and thickets.
Señors," impressively, "if our live stock are to leave
their bones bleaching anywhere this season, why send
them abroad to seek this privilege?"
</p>

<p>
"Brava!" said the giant Higuera, smiling approval.
</p>

<p>
Some one then spoke of the pasturage away to the
south, in the valley of the Salinas, or even the rolling
lands of Santa Barbara.  But the feed could but poorly
support the herds already there, so one said who
recently had traveled about.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza resumed his seat, since no one spoke further.
For a moment he silently regarded his neighbors.  At
last: "Friends and brothers mine, Señor Peralta has
spoken of the north country as a possible solution for
our imminent difficulties.  Señor Zelaya is right.  The
Russian bear, as well as the California grizzly, would
divide our property by piecemeal there.  There are
yet the river beds of the Sacramento and the San
Joaquin."
</p>

<p>
"But Yoscolo and Stanislaus and their thousand
renegades!" objected one.  "We go to the mouth of
the tiger.  More than ever are these men active now."
</p>

<p>
"Our fighting peons equal in strength their recreant
fellows.  Nothing remains but for us to cross the passes
to the soft bottom lands in the eastern valleys.  Señors,
shall we go?"
</p>

<p>
The Administrator's judgment was accepted, and
the visitors, standing, drank another glass of brandy
and departed.
</p>

<p>
Early the next day began a great exodus of cattle
and horses through mountain defile, north and south,
to the flat lowlands across the mountain ranges, Indian
vaqueros, peons armed with bows and arrows, and here
and there a Spaniard with a flint-lock musket going with
the herds.
</p>

<p>
Despite the general departure of live stock the late
spring saw wondrous commotion about the watering
troughs of Señor Mendoza.  Cattle from the hills, from
the marshes of the bay, from no one knew where, scented
water and rushed in thirst-madness to the Mission of
San José; bellowing, leaping, rolling over and over in
their frenzy to reach the water!
</p>

<p>
All day long did the vaqueros rush into the surging
tumult, springing with the swiftness of the cat from
back to back of cattle or horse in the plunging mass,
separating the press here to save the weaker animals
from suffocation, opening lanes there to allow ingress
to the troughs.  Bellowing of cattle mingled with
neighing of horses in wildest confusion.  Famine showed
feverlike in their eyes and echoed madly in their cries.
During the day the battle raged, but at night they
drew away to the hills looking for the lower tree-foliage
and the scanty leaf-forage.
</p>

<p>
Then came other animals to the water.  Thirst drew
them from the mountains and drove away their fear of
man.  The gaunt bear lapped from the trough, and
though the bow of the hunter was bent and the arrow
aimed to slay, pity withheld the arrow.
</p>

<p>
The timid deer stood unafraid at the side of its
ancient enemies, man and bear.  The scream of the
mountain lion mingled with the howl of the wolf, as they
ran about among men, looking for food after they had
quenched their thirst at the watering place.
</p>

<p>
Some strange chivalry, deep residing in the beasts of
prey, held the weaker denizens of the wildwood in safety
from claw and fang.  In their dire adversity came a
literal fulfillment of the old prophecy that the lion and
the lamb should lie down together.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza and his friends faced bravely the difficult
situation.
</p>

<p>
"Our Indian brother shows now his likeness of spirit
to the four-footed dwellers of the wood.  Famine
madness possesses both.  Together do they roam by day
and weirdly cry by night," said Mendoza in the council
of his neighbors.
</p>

<p>
"The Indians lack not food or water," said some one.
"What need of such strange actions?"
</p>

<p>
"The savage is close to the surface in every nature,"
replied Mendoza.  "Among our Indian friends the
outcropping is more easily apparent."
</p>

<p>
Several began speaking at the same time, an unusual
thing in that placid assembly.  Like a murmur it began,
but rose to distinct word and ordered expression.  "Our
wives, our children, our lives, are in danger from these
mad wards the province has given us."
</p>

<p>
"Our soldiers are at the pueblo," said one.
</p>

<p>
"They number less than fifty.  The Indians have
strength and to spare to drive our few troopers into the
San Francisco bay," said Zelaya.
</p>

<p>
"Why were so many aborigines trained in the use of
the musket and lance?" from some one else.
</p>

<p>
"They have fought our battles against their untamed
brethren for a generation," replied Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
As usual this meeting was in Mendoza's house.
Directly across the road was the Mission church.
</p>

<p>
As if to give emphasis to the fears but just expressed
from everywhere there came the peculiar semitone that
only moccasined feet can make.  A thousand footfalls
centered their way to the old adobe church.  The
Indians poured through the open doors into the auditorium
until it overflowed.  Like restless ants those who
could not get within ran around the building, filling
every approach, surging in resistless multitude, as did
the thirst-driven cattle around the water source.
</p>

<p>
"They have gone entirely mad!  First they will destroy
the church, then fall on our families and on us,"
came somewhere from the elders.  "Let us fly to our
hacienda houses, barricade our gates, and fight to the
end."
</p>

<p>
"Let us wait," suggested Mendoza, "and see further."
</p>

<p>
With sudden impulse the aborigines began to move
from side to side in singular unison.  At first they
uttered no sound, then came a crooning of strange
medleys in lifeless, indistinct tones.
</p>

<p>
"They commence thus their war dance!"
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza shrugged.
</p>

<p>
A tall Indian mounted the church steps.  He turned.
His face was wrinkled, his long hair, white, yet
straight and sturdy he stood before the undulating
throng.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis old Juan Antonio, major-domo of the Mission
there.  When did he come from the region of the San
Joaquin?  He and the padre drove thither their cattle
even before we sent away ours."
</p>

<p>
The man waved his hand over the people.  The tumult
was lessened.  From the church came the soft chords of
the organ.  A powerful voice intoned.
</p>

<p>
"My soul hath magnified the Lord and my spirit hath
rejoiced in God, my Saviour."
</p>

<p>
The organ swelled in thunder notes, as the faithful
within the church took up the antistrophe:
</p>

<p>
"For behold he hath regarded the humility of his
handmaid, and from henceforth all generations shall
call me blessed."
</p>

<p>
Thus was sung the Magnificat.
</p>

<p>
A man came out to the church door.  Youth was on
face and figure, but care and illness lined his features
and bowed the shoulders that showed broad even under
his friar's robe.  In movements as graceful as a
feather's dip he pointed to the Indians, then to their
homes scattered over valley and hill.  In another
gesture he motioned to the neophytes to be on their way.
They looked stolidly at one another, then back to the
padre who remained standing with his arm outstretched.
Savagery flamed anew in their faces.  With the growl
of an angry beast about to rend its prey they rushed
up the steps.  The friar, motionless, still stood before
them, still pointing to their houses.  The mob charged
on.  They were but a pace distant when, as one man,
they paused, held in check by the unswerving calm of the
churchman.  Back from him, step by step, they went
till the ground was reached.  Again they paused and
looked up at the friar, indecision written on their faces.
The padre did not move.  With a single impulse they
turned homeward and silently filed along the road, in
obedience to Padre Osuna's unspoken command.  Soon
the friar and Juan Antonio were alone.  They walked
down to a courtyard gate not unlike Señor Mendoza's,
and disappeared within.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza and his friends had witnessed the drama to
its close.
</p>

<p>
A rumbling sounded in the distance which soon
resolved itself into the measured tramp of horses, so
many that their coming shook the ground.  The riders,
in uniform, with lance in hand and carbine slung over
shoulder, pushed their mounts foaming at mouth and
flank to the courtyard gate.
</p>

<p>
"The cavalry from San José!" cried Mendoza.
"What brings them in such haste?"
</p>

<p>
An officer sprang from his horse.
</p>

<p>
The Administrator opened his window.  "Captain
Morando!"
</p>

<p>
The Captain saluted.
</p>

<p>
"Why this force, Señor Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Message was hurried to me that your Indians, frenzied
by pagan rites, were about to make an attack.  I
gathered my men, together with such volunteers as the
pueblo afforded, and hot-foot came to the rescue.  I
see, instead, the Indians going quietly to their homes.
What does it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Come within, Señor Captain."
</p>

<p>
In a moment Morando stood with the others.
</p>

<p>
The señor told him of the coming of the padre and
his dispersal of the Indians.
</p>

<p>
Señorita Carmelita entered the room, bowing to her
father, then to the others.
</p>

<p>
"O, papacito, my Indian maids who ran away last
week, in their madness, are back all sane and cool.  They
ask your forgiveness and a new lease of service."
</p>

<p>
"You alone have to do with them, my child."
</p>

<p>
The Captain was standing at attention.  Red lightly
tinged the girl's cheek as she saw him.  She again bowed,
and went out, with "I thank you, papacito."
</p>

<p>
The Indian maidens were heard on the outside loudly
wailing their thanks to the señorita, as was the way of
children of the wild when penitent.
</p>

<p>
"Señors, we need&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Rain," interrupted the quiet Higuera.
</p>

<p>
"Señors," continued Zelaya, taking no notice of the
interruption, "we need thank the reverend padre for his
work this day.  Besides, he is ill, and even an enemy
who is ill is entitled to our consideration and sympathy.
I do not mean he is our enemy," he quickly added.
</p>

<p>
"I shall do myself the honor of calling upon him,"
came from Mendoza.  "As Administrator of this Mission
and its lands I am interested in everyone in the Mission,
including its spiritual head.  Some Jesuit bark I chance
to have will not come amiss in this fever of the river
bottoms.  I fancy but little remains in the province."
</p>

<p>
The company departed, the soldiery to the San José
pueblo, the land barons to their hacienda houses.
</p>

<p>
The hundreds of white adobe cots which swarmed
around each grandee's mansion, as well as around the
Mission buildings, sheltered that evening the retainer
occupants who for days had forgotten service to their
feudal lords and the ways civilization had taught them.
Once more hill and valley were dotted with the blaze of
camp fires before the Indian doorposts.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br />
A DIP INTO THE PAST
</h3>

<p>
The family Mendoza had deserved well of the Spanish
crown.  Stanch supporters of the kingdom had
they ever been.  Their talents, their wealth, their lives
they held only as in trust to be devoted, whenever came
the call, to the higher, the nobler good.
</p>

<p>
Adventurous too were the citizens of that name.
With Pizarro they overthrew the Incas of Peru.  With
Hernando Cortez they stormed the place of strength
of the Montezumas.  Their swords flashed north and
south in the conquering of vast empires.  Few of them
returned from these scenes of glory, and of those few
the greater part were maimed and broken men.  The
native arrow or the fever swamp claimed life or health
of the valiant conquistador, not excepting the famous
Mendozas.
</p>

<p>
Thus sifted in the sieve of centuries, the family
Mendoza fell gradually in numbers from men sufficient to
fill half a regiment, as in the old crusader times, to but
two representatives, of whom the younger was Jesus
Maria y José.
</p>

<p>
By law of entail the elder brother received the land
and fortunes of that once powerful family.  A
lieutenantship in the army was the portion of the young
Jesus Maria y José, a slender consolation, it might
seem, but the bold-spirited youth accepted it with
gracious willingness.
</p>

<p>
His eighteenth year found him embarking on a transport
bound for the dangerous service of the Philippines,
with a soldiery gathered from the Spanish prisons.  To
quell and govern such men was a pleasing experience
to the Castilian boy; not that the task was an easy
one, or that he would have it so.
</p>

<p>
In the becalmed waters of the tropics the sterling
metal of the youthful officer first showed itself.  Here
the mutinous intent of the men, long smoldering under
restraint of discipline, resolved into action.
</p>

<p>
Early one morning the alarm bell rang loud of
danger.  The officers hurried on deck to find nearly
every soldier under arms and calling aloud for vengeance
on the oppressors, as they called their superiors.
The leader was a huge, bull-necked cutthroat who once
had been a bandit in the Pyrenees.
</p>

<p>
"Each mincing ladies' man among you shall walk the
plank, before the guns of my brave fellows here, and
we'll cheer you pretty, scented gentlemen as you battle
in the water with the sharks," shouted the jeering
leader.
</p>

<p>
Shouts of applause came from the men, mingled with
jibes and curses.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza asked of his captain that he be allowed
to speak with the chief mutineer.  He stated briefly his
purpose.  Permission was given, for the situation was
desperate.
</p>

<p>
The officers, but a score, faced full five hundred men,
all armed.  Even the artillery of the regiment, shotted
to the mouth, was gaping angrily at them from the
ranks of the ruffians across deck.
</p>

<p>
The lieutenant walked to the front bearing his naked
rapier in his hand, while the mutinous soldiers, half
drunken with liquor looted from the stores of the ship,
howled at him.
</p>

<p>
"Mamma's pet comes straight from the bath to drive
about as cattle men that are men.  Back to your crib,
you reptile infant, or I'll grind you under my heel,"
threatened the leader.
</p>

<p>
In incoherent echo his followers stormed: "Throw
him to the sharks, for cubs become wolves&mdash;cut him
into pieces&mdash;cast him into the ovens!"
</p>

<p>
"Attention!" called the young man.
</p>

<p>
Something, perhaps innate animal respect for
bravery, called for obedience.  Silence and expectancy
fell over them.
</p>

<p>
"You pretend to despise all your officers.  I am the
youngest and least among them, yet I dare the best
among you to fight me here, I with this light rapier
against your heavy cutlass."
</p>

<p>
The boastful leader pushed forward.  Around the
villain's head swung his cutlass flaming and glancing
in the tropic sun.
</p>

<p>
"Aha!  Aha! young sprig!" in half-drunken glee.
"Hear the whistling air divide before my cutlass's edge.
I'll strip you from your skin, inch by inch, and dry it
on your cabin door.  Come now, point to point, you
young patrician fool!"
</p>

<p>
He struck a cleaving blow at the figure before him.
The lieutenant's rapier caught the descending blade,
wound itself in serpentine curves around it and drew
away.  The cutlass hurtled to the floor a half dozen
paces distant.  Numbness seized the mutineer's arm
from wrist to shoulder.  He examined the member in
search of a wound, but found none.
</p>

<p>
The pack of insubordinates, impelled by their
wolf-nature, would follow the leader if he conquered, or rend
him if he fell.
</p>

<p>
Murmurs like the first swell of an angry sea rose
among the mob, then burst into yells of derision.
</p>

<p>
"A schoolboy makes our mighty leader play the
fool!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he swings his cutlass as a housewife the broom."
</p>

<p>
"Throw him overboard and elect a man, not some
awkward cow!"
</p>

<p>
Young Mendoza stood with rapier poised, aimed at
his opponent's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Curse the tricks of feinting and legerdemain your
namby-pamby schools teach you in Madrid.  Drop your
steel fork there and I'll tear you to pieces with my
hands."
</p>

<p>
Instantly the rapier was side by side with the cutlass.
</p>

<p>
The leader darted forward, his fists striking flaillike
blows at the lithe form of the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza stepped lightly to one side.  The opponent
stumbled past him.
</p>

<p>
As the mutineer turned, the open palms of the clever
boxer landed right and left with resounding smack on
his nose and mouth.  Raging and cursing, the ruffian
again sprang at the officer.  Once, twice, thrice, did the
youth's palms beat tattoo on his adversary's bleeding
features.  Dazed by the blows the man at last fell to
the deck.
</p>

<p>
Hoarse, derisive cries from the band of mutineers
again greeted the prostrate man.
</p>

<p>
"He went forth to chastise a babe, but, behold! it is
a wondrous infant," groaned some fellow.  "Rise up,
brave one, a chance this time may help thee land that
useless fist of thine."
</p>

<p>
The leader writhed alike at the ignominy of defeat
and at the irony of his followers.  Drawing a knife, as
he gained his feet, he flew at Mendoza, despite warning
cries even from the ranks of his own men.
</p>

<p>
The weapon drove straight out with murderous intent.
A hush fell over both officers and mutineers.
</p>

<p>
It seemed an age before the blow came.
</p>

<p>
It struck on empty air, for the youth, as before, had
deftly stood aside.  As the other was driven past by
his own momentum the boy seized him by the waist and
neckband, raised him from the deck, and whirling him
over his head, flung him headlong from the taffrail to
the sea below.
</p>

<p>
A man-eating shark which had been following the
ship swam toward its prospective prey.  Its back fins
swirled through the water, as it came dashing up.  The
poor wretch shrieked in agony.  He tried to climb the
slippery wood of the ship's side.  Time after time he
struck deep into the planks the knife which he still held,
in vain endeavor to raise himself out of the water by
this leverage.
</p>

<p>
"Help! help, friends, in the Virgin's name!" he entreated.
</p>

<p>
The shark had nearly reached him and was already
turning on its side in preparation for its stroke of
death.
</p>

<p>
Helplessness seemed to possess all.
</p>

<p>
A figure fell from the taffrail to the side of the
desperate man.  It was none other than Lieutenant
Mendoza.  Balancing himself lightly in the water, he
wrenched the knife from his enemy's hand, and, as the
shark came up, he buried it to the handle in the
monster's brain.  Its jaws snapped sullenly not the
inches of a span away from the head of the screaming
bully.  Floundering helplessly the creature rolled away.
Other man-eating sharks came to the scene.  Some of
them seized on their helpless brother and tore at his
flesh while he still lived.  Others swam straight for the
human beings at the side of the ship.
</p>

<p>
By this time the spectators had recovered power of
action.  A boat was quickly lowered.  Muskets and
pistols in numbers were fired at the onrushing school
of sharks.
</p>

<p>
Soon the rescued and rescuer were safe on board.
There was talk among the officers of court-martials and
executions, with the outcome, that, after much persuasion
on the part of the young lieutenant, the commander
granted his request that the leader be pardoned
pending his good behavior.
</p>

<p>
The troops were not again recalcitrant.
</p>

<p>
From the swamps and the heat of the Philippines
Captain Mendoza&mdash;for he had been promoted&mdash;returned
to Europe.  Events which shook the world were
stirring there.  As an eagle flies to the rescue of its
eyrie so hastened the descendant of the valiant Mendozas
to the Spain of his fathers, to do battle for its
safety.
</p>

<p>
The figure of Napoleon loomed ominously against
Europe's peace.  His ambitious hand was reaching for
the crown of Spain, as, indeed, for all other crowns.
</p>

<p>
Into the awful carnage plunged Mendoza.  A hundred
blows he struck at the terrible Corsican, even
though, often enough, the recoil threw him and his
command reeling backward in defeat.  Nevertheless,
did he right nobly add honor and renown to the
spotless banner of his house.
</p>

<p>
Only when Napoleon was exiled to Elba did he leave
the field.  Then, in command of his regiment, as
colonel, he returned to Madrid.
</p>

<p>
His elder brother, rich in titles and wealth, influential
at the Cortes, united his personal petition with the
strong voice of the colonel's service in the field, to obtain
for the younger man place and emolument.
</p>

<p>
The vast region of Alta California was then coming
into great and favorable notice.  Need there would
surely be, in the Californias, of men of mettle and of
wisdom to hold that province and its riches secure to
Spanish rule.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, large parcels of land in the valley of
Santa Clara, fairest and most fertile in all that western
Eden, California, were conferred by letters-patent on
the soldier, Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
He loved a lady fair&mdash;Romalda.  What man of his
family had not?  Every knight of La Mancha had his
Dulcinea, and Jesus Maria y José was true to his
descent, even to the very finger-tips.  The old crusader
Mendozas, whose faces were carved in marble or painted
on canvas in the ancestral home in Castile, had not been
more chivalrous and romantic than was this now famous
colonel.
</p>

<p>
Beautiful daydreams he wove and told to the listening
ears of the noble lady.  He had seen California, and
knew well that part of it where his estate lay.  The
fire of poetry touched his words, as he sketched for her
the estate mightier in length and breadth than any in
Castile, fairer than Elysian fields, more fertile than the
Andalusian meadows.
</p>

<p>
No landscape painter could limn mountains more
picturesque and stately than did the words of Don
Jesus Maria y José describe the eastern boundary of
their domain in the land of far-away California.  No
minstrel could tell, in song or verse, of lake or bay so
fair, so blue, as the inland sea which laved the western
limit of their home-to-be.
</p>

<p>
Lady Romalda hearkened, and she smiled approvingly
as she gave him her hand to kiss at parting.
</p>

<p>
"Soon will I return and claim my bride.  The days I
spend in the Californias, in preparation for your
coming, will be as months and years to me."
</p>

<p>
She smiled kindly yet again, and waved a kiss at him
as he rode forth from her father's gate to prepare the
home for her across the many seas.
</p>

<p>
The soldier reached his California estate in due
season, and with industry set about his task of love.
</p>

<p>
A hacienda house reached high its walls on an eminence
near the mountain side of the estate.  Moorish
in architecture, its towers proudly surveyed the leagues
of miles comprising the Mendoza grant.  Tree and
plant and flower smiled around it in the genial warmth
of semitropic atmosphere.  Avenues of olive lined its
approaches.  The Mission grapevine draped many
arbors which were arranged in labyrinthine plan, all
centering, after infinite curious turns, at the front door
of the mansion.
</p>

<p>
Many ships brought furnishings from the world over
for this wonderful palace.
</p>

<p>
The herds fattened for the killing, and were of great
increase on this domain, as needs be, for the expense
of the hacienda house was in keeping with its size and
beauty.
</p>

<p>
At last all was ready for the bride.  But&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mexico had declared for independence, and was
making good this declaration by force of arms.
California would be compelled either to stand with Mexico
or to fall with mother Spain.  Colonel Mendoza's natural
gifts included statecraft.  He did not oppose the
inevitable.  California became a province of the
republic of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Now hastened the Colonel to claim his bride.  In
Madrid he found his brother dead, leaving no direct
heir.  The soldier-cavalier claimed title and estates, but
the royal court rebuffed him.  He was a foreigner now.
His acceptance of Mexican dominion had cost him his
Spanish citizenship.  The laws of entail debarred him
from succession.
</p>

<p>
He urged the inevitableness of the separation of
Mexico from Spain, also his years of service in the
Spanish army; likewise the claims of his family to the
good will of the kingdom.  All was in vain.
</p>

<p>
Hastening to the castle of his betrothed, he made
known his presence, and asked to see the Lady Romalda.
</p>

<p>
Her father met him in his stead.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter, the noble doña, desires to see you not,
Sir Foreigner.  For my part I request that you depart
from this place and never return."
</p>

<p>
"Foreigner or not, I'll hear the rejection from the
lady's own lips.  I demand to see the Lady Romalda,
my affianced wife."
</p>

<p>
After much parley the father brought his daughter
to see the determined man.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza told her again of the home prepared for
her near the shores of the sunny Pacific, of the beauty
and luxuriance well-nigh Oriental, of the wealth of
the land, of the promise of the future.
</p>

<p>
"Peons, slaves, señorita, numbering hundreds, await
your pleasure there.  A princess will you be, and I will
be your lover-husband.  Say you will come with me."
</p>

<p>
The Lady Romalda smiled coldly.  "You may become
a self-styled prince among a barbarous and rebellious
people.  Be assured I shall never be a princess
of such dishonor."
</p>

<p>
She swept in disdain from the room.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza returned to Madrid.  Calling on the
commander-in-chief of the Spanish army, he held before
him the written letters of his colonelcy.
</p>

<p>
"This paper means I am a colonel in the army of this
kingdom.  I am such no more."  He tore in halves the
commission.
</p>

<p>
"Are you a madman, Colonel Mendoza?" asked the
general.
</p>

<p>
"Behold!"
</p>

<p>
Bending his sword over his knee he broke it into
pieces and cast them on the floor.  "By this act I
forswear Spain forever."
</p>

<p>
The old general began to remonstrate with him, but
Mendoza turned on his heel and was gone.
</p>

<p>
Great preparations were under way for the return
to California of the lord of the rancho Mendoza with his
lady bride.  The whole valley was ready to make the
occasion a gala time.
</p>

<p>
Alone, and by night, he came.  Calling his major-domos
and head peons together, he gave orders which
were to be executed early on the morrow, by his
thousand vassals.
</p>

<p>
They were frightened.  "Our master is out of his
head!" they exclaimed in awe-struck tones.  Hastening
they told some of the Spanish neighbors of the return
of Señor Mendoza and of his startling commands.
</p>

<p>
The Spanish confreres were soon at the castlelike
hacienda house.
</p>

<p>
"Señor, the Colonel Mendoza&mdash;&mdash;" began one.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza I am.  Never again colonel."
</p>

<p>
"But, señor, the peons tell us of your strange desires."
</p>

<p>
"My desires shall be executed, strange or not.  At
daybreak to-morrow not a stone stands on stone in this
hacienda house.  On these grounds not tree or plant
or shrub stands unuprooted before the darkness of
another day."
</p>

<p>
"But, señor, has your visit to Spain affected&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My visit to Spain has affected me greatly.  Friends
and neighbors, at another time I, and all I have, shall
be at your disposal.  Permit me now to bid you good-night."
</p>

<p>
Very early next morning the hills echoed to the
titanic roar of the powder magazine under the
hacienda house, which had been kept there for uses of
the hunt, and for defense and offense.  Señor Mendoza's
own hand had lighted the train.  Soon fire skirted
toppling tower and parapet, searched ruined reception
halls, licked up furniture and bric-à-brac, and charred
rare valuables.  Daylight saw not Moorish castle, but
blocks of blackened building stones and smoking rubbish.
</p>

<p>
Countless peons, with spades, picks and axes, dug up
the green and growing things, broke down terraces,
tore away grape arbors, and everywhere did works
of devastation.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza, as if commanding in battle, directed
his workmen.  Trees and shrubs were piled high.  Fire,
made hotter by kegs of turpentine, soon brought all
to ash-heaps.  Great pits were dug into which the stones
of the hacienda building were placed, also the ashes
from the bonfires.
</p>

<p>
"Now," commanded Mendoza, "fill in these trenches."
</p>

<p>
It was done.
</p>

<p>
"Señors," he said at nightfall, when all was over,
"thus I bury the past.  Henceforth, remember, I pray
you, that I am Señor Mendoza, the Californian, that,
and that only."
</p>

<p>
The rains of the following winter made the site of
the once-beautiful castle and grounds again a part of
the rolling, grassy lands overlooking the valley.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza devoted himself faithfully to the
interests of his rancho and the welfare of California.
</p>

<p>
He built another home five miles from where the first
had been, and altogether out of sight of it; a house of
California style, the buildings forming three sides of
a square, with a wall making the fourth side of the
courtyard within.
</p>

<p>
In middle life the wish had come to found a family
to succeed him in his possessions.  He married the
daughter of a neighbor, a maiden of Castilian blood,
but of California birth.  A child was born to them, a
daughter, and in that hour his wife died.  Never
was parent kinder or gentler than Señor Mendoza to
the Doña Carmelita, his pride and joy.
</p>

<p>
The authorities in Mexico City thought it right to
deprive the Franciscan friars of a part of the lands
they held in Alta California, this act of the secularization
of the missions causing comment of both approval
and disapproval.
</p>

<p>
The leaders in the capital city chose Señor Mendoza
to administer the claims of church and state in the
valley of Santa Clara.  Thus he became administrator
of the Mission of San José, where the opening of this
story found him, a man of strength and of honesty, a
statesman and a courtly gentleman.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br />
A STRANGER VISITS SEÑOR MENDOZA
</h3>

<p>
"Papacito mine, I'm all ready for the party this
evening.  My maids have just finished with me.
What do you think of me?"
</p>

<p>
The Señorita Carmelita pirouetted into her father's
sitting room, stood on one foot, then on the other,
finally turning completely around.
</p>

<p>
"Papacito, what do you think of me?" she asked
again.
</p>

<p>
The father knit his brows in pretended deep consideration.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry!  Hurry, papacito!  Really I can't wait any
longer, I'm so anxious to know."
</p>

<p>
"My child, you make me think of a very pretty, very
dainty wild flower."
</p>

<p>
"Just a flower, papacito?" in mock disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a flower with laughing eyes, splendid hair, and
white plumage," pointing to her dress.
</p>

<p>
"That's better, little papa, somewhat better.  Isn't
it magnificent that we're to have a valecito casero?  In
school in Mexico City we went to bed regularly at eight
o'clock.  To-night it will be midnight, and later.  When
I think of my present freedom and the old school days
my heart rejoices itself; yet I loved the school and
everyone in it.  Often in dreams I am in those old rooms
overlooking the Plaza Mercedes, and I hear the splashing
of the fountains and the singing of the birds."
</p>

<p>
"My child's heart lives in scenes left behind months
ago, yet the spirit rejoices in present liberty.  Well, it
is the way of the world."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita was sitting on the arm of her father's chair
stroking his face and hands, and occasionally giving
gentle pulls to his long mustache.  Strangely alike
were these two, the slender, dark-eyed girl, and the
stalwart, graying man, athletic-appearing even in his
years.  The waving mane above his forehead was
the prototype of the coal-black hair of the señorita
which billowed over her shoulders and fell below her
waist.
</p>

<p>
His cheek was bronze, showing dashes of red; hers
was creamy, with the blush of youth surmounting; but
it was the contour of face and form of both, strongly
chiseled, yet superbly fine, that bespoke a model
fashioned and perfected generations before in aristocratic
Spain.
</p>

<p>
"What a philosopher my father is!"  Then, after a
moment: "Yesterday Señor Zelaya said to Señor Higuera,
as they passed along the corridor, 'But the
Administrator says that we must educate ourselves to a
deeper appreciation&mdash;'  I did not catch the rest.  Señor
Higuera replied, 'And the Administrator has a philosophy
of deep and wide application.'  Tell me about it."
</p>

<p>
"My daughter, I think you would prefer a more
interesting story.  My philosophy, if you made it rightly,
has been long in coming to me.  On the other hand,
the estate of womanhood now present with you seems to
have grown overnight."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita arose, curtsied to her father, then
resumed her seat.
</p>

<p>
"But my philosophy touches not any abstract principle.
It deals only with powers that move the human
heart."
</p>

<p>
"Vast political forces are astir in this old world of
ours.  The theory that God appoints kings is rapidly
dissipating.  The sun of democracy, long mantled by
the fog of tyranny, shines soon in unobscured ray.  In
the to-morrow of to-morrow shall the people rule, as
their right divine."
</p>

<p>
The señorita smiled into her father's eyes.  "Lolita
Hernandez once said to me, a long time ago, when she
was petulant, that my father is a rebel.  I replied by
calling her a minx."
</p>

<p>
The old don made no reply; but continued: "'Westward
the course of empire takes its way.'  An English
poet sings this truly and well.  To the east of California
is a republic destined to a colossal future, because it is
founded on the principle that all men are created equal,
and its national life rises toward a realization of that
truth.  To that height must rise not alone the Saxon
but the Latin as well.
</p>

<p>
"The geography of nations in our Western world
must soon change, under the influence of the democratic
idea.  As certain as the sun rose this morning and now
urges to the setting, will either the American or the
English flag float from the staff within our courtyard
before our province has seen but a few more years of
life."
</p>

<p>
"But," hesitatingly from the girl, "will you not fight
against this aggression?"
</p>

<p>
"No; nor could I stem the tide if I did.  The logic
of events grinds, as do the mills of the gods, exceeding
fine.  In the great world battle between people and
potentate, victory, final and complete, will rest one
day with the people.  The cost of that battle will be
measured in centuries of time, the blood of nations, the
sacrifice of warriors and statesmen.  Runnymede, in
the south of England, in the year 1215, saw the beginning
of the conflict when the people forced King John
to sign the Magna Charta!"
</p>

<p>
"History speaks of the family de la Mendoza as made
up of warriors.  Your own name, father mine, is
mentioned, and not as the least, yet you will never speak
to me of any battle."
</p>

<p>
He pointed to a small painting.  It depicted Waterloo.
</p>

<p>
"I'd give my experience of all the battles I've seen
could I have stood there that evening with Wellington,
on Mount Saint Jean, when the sun of day had set and
Napoleon's sun of destiny with it.  I would have
rejoiced to have chased the emperor of the French over
the plowed field at night, as does a hound drive the
hare.  Yet&mdash;what matters it all?  As well for Napoleon
to rule, or misrule, as for any other tyrant, be he
anointed king or not.  The day of the people comes,
and I rejoice."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we follow new ways and customs then, my father?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite possibly.  And yet, think you not it a pretty
custom when the Spaniard comes with his guitar and
improvises sweet music outside the embrasure window
of the señorita?  No?"
</p>

<p>
The doña blushed rosy red.
</p>

<p>
"What a papacito!" kissing him to cover her
confusion.  "How shall the señorita inside the embrasure
prevent the music-inclined caballero on the outside from
touching the strings of his guitar?"
</p>

<p>
Mendoza laughed while looking fondly at his daughter.
</p>

<p>
"You ask me how the doña may discourage the
suitor?  Ah, little one, how can I tell you?  The claws
show sharp and repelling, or presto! all is soft and
smooth as velvet.  What works the wonder, ask you?
Ah, Carmelita mia!  Lolita Hernandez is not the only
minx in the world."
</p>

<p>
The girl playfully tugged at her father's thick hair.
</p>

<p>
"What a father is mine!  He has seen all things and
has accomplished all things," changing the subject.
"Has ever there been an ungratified wish in your life,
except the one to chase the emperor of the French
across plowed fields?  If so, now is your chance.  I will
be your fairy godmother.  Come, make your wish, and,
behold!  It is done."
</p>

<p>
She had slipped from the chair and standing, held
her arms extended over him.  "Make your wish now,"
laughingly.
</p>

<p>
"My child, I have a wish, but its fulfillment would
involve the folding together of events that time has
unfolded; indeed, the turning backward of time."
</p>

<p>
She dropped her hands in concern.  "O, papacito,
tell me your desire," coming again to the arm of his
chair.
</p>

<p>
He did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"O, little papa, you are so serious.  Please tell me
what it is."
</p>

<p>
"I wish, little girl, that as a stripling I had come here
and had built my life into this Western world.  That
favor of kings I had never known&mdash;I care nothing for
their disfavor&mdash;but of my own self, coupled with the
resources with which nature has endowed California, I
had evolved the best that fortune would have sent me,
were it hacienda house and administratorship, or a humble
hut with modest plot of ground, such as has the least
of my peons."
</p>

<p>
A tap at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Enter," from Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
A peon stepped within.  Thrice he bowed low to the
master, then to the doña.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza, a stranger awaits you in the outer
office."
</p>

<p>
"Does he give his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Here it is, señor."
</p>

<p>
The peon porter handed Mendoza a piece of paper on
which was written, in bold, rough characters, "Charles
O'Donnell."
</p>

<p>
"O'Donnell&mdash;O'Donnell&mdash;Let him enter."
</p>

<p>
The peon again bowed low to the master and his
daughter.  Backing through the door, he bowed once
more.  Almost immediately the stranger, O'Donnell,
stood in the doorway.  Señor Mendoza was on his feet
formally awaiting his visitor.
</p>

<p>
The man's broad, strong shoulders touched from
doorpost to doorpost, his head barely coming within
the door without his stooping.  His buckskin shirt,
opening low at the front, showed the long, red beard
which was fastened together by a cord, and disappeared
into the expanse of his chest.
</p>

<p>
His hair, darker than his beard, was long and bushy.
This also was caught by a string and was partially
hidden under his shirt.
</p>

<p>
Steely-blue eyes looked out over regular features.  A
sombrero was in his hand.  His buckskin trousers were
protected from hip to knee by shaggy leggings of bearskin.
</p>

<p>
"Señor O'Donnell, will you enter and be seated?"
</p>

<p>
"I thank you."  The stranger moved toward a chair
with dignified and soldierly step.
</p>

<p>
"Señor, the Administrator Mendoza, I am here to
inquire if you know of the present whereabouts of one
Captain Farquharson, an Englishman who left Mexico
City some months ago to hunt big game in our high
Sierras here."
</p>

<p>
"Señor O'Donnell, why do you ask of me the present
abiding place of this Englishman?  I am Administrator
of the Mission of San José.  My jurisdiction does not
reach to the high Sierras, nor to the city of Mexico."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza's glance was careless as he thus replied to
the questioner.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, worthy señor, you are a well-known man in Alta
California.  Not less, perhaps, is your name known in
the Mexican capital.  What wonder, then, if some
leisured traveler touching that capital should bear
written words thence to you here?  So I rode to you on my
errand of inquiry.  If you know nothing of the man, I
shall ride still farther on my quest."
</p>

<p>
"Señor O'Donnell, famine is abroad, since the rains
fall not.  Entertainment for yourself and feed for your
horse are welcome to you in my hacienda.  Why not
rest here for a while?  Perhaps some of my major-domos
may have news of this captain, or some of the
peons recently returned from the headwaters of the
river San Joaquin where our cattle are now grazing.
The Sierras lie but across from these headwaters, and
among our peons are hunters not a few.  Rest among
us, my friend O'Donnell, and from some direction you
may find the information you are seeking."
</p>

<p>
The man shook his head.  "My horse has carried me
a hundred miles to-day, and yet he is ready to bear me
farther.  With such a mount I can find food for myself
and fodder for him, easily, when night falls.  Hear now
his song?  Drumlummon skirls a merry note."
</p>

<p>
With a laugh the bearded man arose.  The screaming
neigh of a stallion was echoing among the buildings of
the hacienda.
</p>

<p>
"My horse is ready for the road.  I thank you for
your hospitality just the same.  Adios, noble
Administrator."
</p>

<p>
"Wait, good Señor O'Donnell.  A glass of wine makes
readier the foot for the stirrup."
</p>

<p>
He touched a bell.  A peon came, and disappeared on
his errand.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, señor, while the wine is coming, do you know
this Englishman of whom you speak as Farquharson?"
</p>

<p>
"Several years ago I saw Captain Farquharson
considerably," tersely.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Señor O'Donnell, you too are a soldier, as your
bearing shows.  You speak of your friend as Captain
Farquharson.  Perhaps you were brother officers in
English service.  Is it so?"
</p>

<p>
"No," hoarsely replied O'Donnell in English, "it was
not so.  I thought I'd done for the fellow that day on
the parade ground&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
As he did not continue Señor Mendoza said: "Ah, my
friend O'Donnell speaks the English.  I have studied
your language and I read your books," indicating a
shelf on which were a number of works by English
historians and political economists.  "Ah, here comes
the wine."
</p>

<p>
"Forgive my curiosity, Señor O'Donnell, in my recent
questioning.  I am greatly interested in English officers.
Just before you came I was speaking with my daughter
of the battle of Waterloo.  You could not have been
present.  You have not years enough," looking at the
face, yet young, of the man before him.
</p>

<p>
"I was not in the army at that time," replied O'Donnell.
"Allow me to say, Señor Administrator, you serve
nectar here," sipping his wine.
</p>

<p>
"This Farquharson," persisted Mendoza, "who you
say is older than you, perhaps he took part in that
famous battle."
</p>

<p>
"I did not say Farquharson is older than I.  I said
I once knew him."
</p>

<p>
A dark look shaded O'Donnell's face as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you were rivals in those times," still
persisted Mendoza, noticing the shadows.  "Some wine in
your glass, my friend?  Well, war and love have made
many an enemy."
</p>

<p>
Again the neigh of the stallion was heard.
</p>

<p>
"Drumlummon's second call.  I must be going.  Perhaps
Captain Farquharson may call on you soon.  Indeed,
I'm sure he will; for I remember now that he has
letters of introduction to you from Don Juan Domingo,
first assistant to the secretary of state of Mexico."
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza bowed courteously, as if some
ordinary information had been given him.
</p>

<p>
A sound of approaching voices reached their ears.
</p>

<p>
"Papacito, our guests are arriving.  I shall leave
you."  Carmelita approached from the rear of the room
where she had been occupied with a book.
</p>

<p>
The squeaking of carretas (wooden wagons) was now
plainly heard, also the tramp of horses, the laughter of
men, and the gay, bantering tones of women.  Anon
arose the angry cry of O'Donnell's stallion.
</p>

<p>
"The guests are truly coming.  Carmelita, my child,
see that the servants neglect neither duty nor courtesy."
</p>

<p>
To O'Donnell, who was standing ready to depart:
"Señor, I'll attend you myself as you go forth."
</p>

<p>
Soon the dressing rooms were filled with young girls,
laughing and joyous.  A dash of powder on the face,
the hair smoother, laces adjusted, all under the
watchful eye of mother or dueña.
</p>

<p>
The young dandies in their rooms were scarcely less
fastidious than their sweethearts and sisters.
</p>

<p>
At a quarter before six the company was assembled
in the reception hall.  Jokes and sallies went around the
room.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita noticed that her father was not present
and sent a peon to call him.  The servant returned with
the word that the señor and the gringo stranger were
in the outer office.  He did not dare disturb them.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes passed.  Merriment grew louder.  Some
one saw on a secretary a chart giving the places of
the guests at table.  The merrymakers crowded around.
</p>

<p>
The doña slipped away and no one noticed.
</p>

<p>
Her father and O'Donnell were standing just outside
the courtyard gate.  Two or three peons were holding
O'Donnell's horse which was restive, pawing and biting
at them.  The two men spoke English and thus freely,
as none of the peons understood that tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Men are playing to-day and an empire makes the
stake," O'Donnell said.  "Farquharson is sitting in the
game, and, by faith! so am I."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza nodded.
</p>

<p>
"And, Administrator Mendoza, so are you&mdash;and the
chief player!  Did not your recent visit to Mexico
acquaint you with the trump card?"
</p>

<p>
Mendoza smiled pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
The stallion came closer to them, dragging the peons
with him.  He seized the shirt of one of them and tore
it from his back.
</p>

<p>
"Quiet, Drumlummon!"  Then to the servants, "Unloose
him."  The huge animal came fawning to his side.
</p>

<p>
Without touching hand to the horse O'Donnell
vaulted the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"A moment, O'Donnell."
</p>

<p>
The man leaned in his saddle.
</p>

<p>
"You say I'm sitting in the game and the stake is
large.  Well said, perhaps.  But remember, if I play
I'll use the card that means the most to the province
of California."  The señor again nodded, as if retailing
some pleasantry of the day.
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell rode away.
</p>

<p>
"Papacito!" called Carmelita.  "It is late.  We are
waiting."
</p>

<p>
In a moment they were with their guests.
</p>

<p>
Folding doors opened and the well-lighted dining
room was before them.
</p>

<p>
At once dinner was under way.  The peons, trained by
Mendoza, served well.  The generous hospitality of
early California found expression in the viands and
vintages which Mendoza offered his guests.  Peons
touched fitting music from stringed instruments; others
sang in the melodious voice of the aborigine.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Mendoza, heard you not that the great
spring merienda comes early this year by reason of the
drought?" asked Captain Morando.
</p>

<p>
"Does a picnic so interest you, Comandante Morando?"
</p>

<p>
"Never have I seen such a picnic as must be the
spring merienda in the valley of Calaveras.  Everywhere
I hear people speak of it."
</p>

<p>
"Soon you may judge of its excellence for yourself.
Now begins to sing my peona, Modesta.  Her voice
equals in sweetness the notes of the thrush.  Listen,
while she gives the ancient airs of Oroysom.  They are
heart-touching and beautiful."
</p>

<p>
The señorita's dueña engaged Moranda's attention
the moment the singing ceased, suddenly remembering
to ask for some acquaintance in San José.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña Mendoza, say I have your first dance
this evening?" called Abelardo Peralto from across
the table.
</p>

<p>
"I, the second," cried Miguel Soto.
</p>

<p>
"I, the third," from another.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña," asked Morando as soon as he was
at liberty, "have you a dance left for me?"
</p>

<p>
"First come, first served, is the law in this province,"
she replied mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am to have no dance with you to-night,"
despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear the saying about the early bird
and the worm, Captain?" laughed Peralta.
</p>

<p>
"I object to being compared to a worm," said
Carmelita.  "For your punishment, Señor Don Abelardo
Peralta, I deprive you of the grand march, which
belongs to the first dance, and I give it to the Señor
Captain."
</p>

<p>
"Woe!  Woe!" cried Peralta.  "I will be the worm,
Señorita Mendoza.  You are the beautiful early bird.
O, do not punish me!"
</p>

<p>
The girl looked at him with mock severity.  "I have
given my sentence."
</p>

<p>
The host touched a bell.
</p>

<p>
"Are we ready for the dancing?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The company cheered heartily.
</p>

<p>
"I hear the musicians tuning their instruments.  Let
us hence.  If we cannot have the patter of rain during
this season of drought, we can at least have the patter
of feet."
</p>

<p>
Laughing and happy, the sons and daughters of the
province repaired to the dancing room.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br />
ANOTHER STRANGER MAKES A VISIT
</h3>

<p>
"I hear the neigh of horses and the shouts of men.
Has Dario, the head vaquero, returned from the
valley of the San Joaquin?  Or, perchance, is it some
messenger from him?"
</p>

<p>
"Reverend padre, you hear the work Indians returning
with their farm animals from the irrigated ground
near the great spring.  It is the noon hour."
</p>

<p>
The first speaker was the friar, Lusciano Osuna,
spiritual head of the Mission San José.  He was
temporal head also of the Mission grounds and buildings,
together with a wide strip of country reaching over
rolling land, hills and mountains, away east to the San
Joaquin River.
</p>

<p>
The padre was ill.  His parched lips and flushed
forehead showed him to be in the grip of fever.  Restlessly
he tossed from side to side of his bed.  It was an
unusual-appearing bed.  Hewn redwood logs of goodly
dimension had been made in a frame held together
by mortising at the corners.  Strips of rawhide ran
across the frame from side to side, another layer from
end to end.  A pallet of straw was the mattress; the
covering was lambskin tanned without removing the wool.
</p>

<p>
"Open the window and the door, Juan Antonio.  My
blood boils away in this heat, and my strength ebbs
out."
</p>

<p>
The hot north wind, which for days had been
scorching the valley of Santa Clara, rolled into the
room.
</p>

<p>
"It is little avail, dear father, to seek or avoid
draughts when the San Joaquin fever possesses one.
Its nature is to burn till the body seems a crisp, then
to freeze till the flesh is like damp clay."
</p>

<p>
"Juan Antonio, you are right.  Still, it is a satisfaction
to feel the living air whether it touches one's ailment
or not."
</p>

<p>
The light from the open window shone on the friar's
face.  He was nervously pulling his heavy black beard
through his fingers.  The features thus brought into
relief were those of the hidalgo, bold and strong, and
were illuminated by keen intelligence within.  The skin
showed another strain darker than Caucasian.
</p>

<p>
"Antonio, did all the Indians attend chapel this
morning?  Have you heard of any further evidences of
lapse into paganism anywhere in the valley?"
</p>

<p>
"Our Indians, men, women and children, are faithful
in their attendance, since the day you quenched the
evil spirit in them.  To-morrow we conclude the
Novena&mdash;nine days' prayer&mdash;for you.  All are praying most
fervently that our Lady and Saint Francis, yes, and
San José, will favor us and you with speedy and
complete recovery."
</p>

<p>
"You are good, very good, my major-domo."
</p>

<p>
"To-day at morning meal were some Indians from
the San Blas just in at Monterey.  At once I dispatched
thither the peon, Pedro Carrasca, the best rider in the
valley.  Six hours' journey it is to Monterey, six hours'
rest, and six returning, makes eighteen.  Pedro Carrasca
rests not if among the ship's goods is numbered
Jesuit bark, but he presses homeward with the medicine.
For each hour less than twelve that he consumes
in rounding Monterey from here I have promised him
five and twenty pesos."
</p>

<p>
"You have done well.  My illness possesses me, Juan
Antonio.  Not that I resist suffering.  Did not my
great master, Saint Francis of Assisi, bear the sacred
stigmata on side and hands and feet?"
</p>

<p>
The Indian reverently made the sign of the cross.
</p>

<p>
The padre went on:
</p>

<p>
"Antonio, you speak of the Novena.  How many days
have we been back?"
</p>

<p>
"Eight days."
</p>

<p>
"It has seemed longer, much longer."
</p>

<p>
"That was a hard ride for you from the river
country, Señor Padre."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was."
</p>

<p>
"Swinging over mountain and scaling precipice, as
did we, is doubly difficult for one scarcely able to sit in
the saddle."
</p>

<p>
"And what found I here?  Men, and women too, whom
our fathers redeemed from savagery, dancing in pagan
worship around fires which, doubtless, shortly would
have become fires of sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
"I know, holy padre; and I remember too that they
followed us to the church, consumed by that strange
fury; yet you drove the blood demon from their hearts,
so that they killed not, nor destroyed, but obeyed your
commands; yes, even till now."
</p>

<p>
The Indian again made the sign of the cross.
</p>

<p>
"It is well to forget&mdash;well to forget," mused the
friar.  "The children, after all, are good children."
</p>

<p>
The padre was endeavoring to hold himself against
some tremendous inward tension.  He clenched his
hands and shut tight his teeth.  Nature could not
sustain him and his teeth began to chatter, while his hands
wrapped the closer the lambskin coverlet about his
form.
</p>

<p>
The Indian major-domo closed the door.  Hastening
to the window he drew the sash into place; then began
chafing the padre's wrists and palms.
</p>

<p>
"Courage, good padre, courage!  A little time and
the blood is warm again, the strength revives.  If only
Pedro Carrasca were here with the Jesuit bark! but
he comes not before nightfall, I fear."
</p>

<p>
The friar's eyes closed listlessly.  His hands grew
colder, despite the vigorous treatment given by the
Indian.  His breath was short and weak.
</p>

<p>
"Dios y Maria!" exclaimed Juan Antonio.  He took
the friar's robe hanging from a peg on the wall, and
carefully spread it over the fainting man.
</p>

<p>
"Comes now the chill and the heart weakens,"
muttered the faithful major-domo.  "That hurried ride
from the San Joaquin, the worry over the Mission, the
drought&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Footsteps sounded in the corridor.  Antonio called,
then gave incisive commands in the Indian tongue.  The
feet scurried away.  He continued the energetic
rubbing, praying the while.
</p>

<p>
Excited voices were heard approaching.  The door
was flung open, and instantly the room was filled with
Indians.  A woman brought a kettle of hot water;
another, a stone vessel.  A man brought a decanter of
aguardiente.  Whispering, praying Indians ran up and
down the corridor.
</p>

<p>
As the women saw the padre's face, white and still,
they thought life had gone out.  Grief filled their hearts,
welled into their eyes and found vent by their tongue.
The loud wail of the death-bedside arose, quavered, fell,
in the old adobe house.
</p>

<p>
Juan Antonio endeavored to silence them.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, with the hot cloths for the feet, Luisa!  Make
ready the heated brandy, you, Crispinilla!  Quick,
women, the padre's need is urgent!"
</p>

<p>
A sigh came from the priest.  Then all was still.  He
seemed to sink lower into his couch.
</p>

<p>
Even Juan Antonio thought that now life was gone.
Instincts of forgotten generations stirred the old man's
heart.  He began to intone the death praises of the
friar, as, for untold years, had his forbears done for
the great ones of their tribe.
</p>

<p>
"The mighty heart is still.  The strong hand bends
not the bow.  The ready feet run not.  The king elk
walks boldly in the open.  The timid deer fears not the
arrow, because the chief man of his people hunts no
more."
</p>

<p>
The refrain of the death-wail overflowed the houses
of the Mission, ran along olive orchard and vineyard,
reached the sentinels watching on the hills.  The church
bell, in sorrowing tone, sounded its toll of death.  One
and thirty did it strike, the total of the years the friar
had lived.
</p>

<p>
At the last stroke the padre's eyelids flickered gently.
The pallor of his cheeks decreased.  Breathing, almost
imperceptible, began.  Finally, he opened his eyes, and
saw the weeping, gesticulating men and women.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" he said feebly.  "What see I here?"
</p>

<p>
Again, in stronger accent, "What see I here?"
</p>

<p>
Yet again, "What see I here!"
</p>

<p>
In this third utterance the churchman spoke as might
a king in presence of his subjects.  The wailing ceased.
</p>

<p>
He raised himself on elbow and pointed to the door.
</p>

<p>
"This cell is within the precinct of sacred cloister.
Go, women, one and all!  Get ye gone from this holy
place!"
</p>

<p>
The women fell away from the bed and seemed to melt
through the door, the men following them.  Soon Juan
Antonio stood alone with the padre.
</p>

<p>
"What have you done?" demanded the friar, sternly.
Perspiration again was on his forehead, while the
returning fever gave color to the face and strength to
the body.
</p>

<p>
"O, Padre Lusciano, I feared you were dying.  All
my thoughts were for nothing but to save you, and I
called for help, come whence it might."
</p>

<p>
"Juan Antonio, around this cell, though poor and
humble, has Holy Church drawn her solemn circle of
isolation.  Let no woman enter herein, even to save my
life.  If I die, then so I must.  Did I pronounce the
curse on the luckless daughter of Eve and her male
abettors in this sacrilege, no one, save the vicar of
Christ in Rome, could banish it.  See, Juan Antonio,
what vast evil thy thoughtless hand might wreak."
</p>

<p>
"O, padre," wept the Indian, "I thought thy life was
struggling to free itself of body, and my heart became
water within me, for I love thee."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Very well.  But, Juan Antonio, in the
future think with thy head, not with love or fear."
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza appeared in the open door.
</p>

<p>
"Reverend Padre Osuna, will you pardon my coming
unannounced?  Each day since you returned have my
servants made inquiry, but found you too ill to receive
a visitor."
</p>

<p>
"Enter, Señor Mendoza.  Please seat yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir Padre.  I had a small quantity of
Jesuit bark, invaluable in this fever-and-ague affliction.
Unfortunately, I mislaid the bark, not finding it till
to-day, and I came but now to bring it in person."
</p>

<p>
"Very kind of you, señor."
</p>

<p>
"I heard the death-wail of the Indians; heard, also,
the toll of the bell marking the passing of an officer of
the church.  Your Indians first told me you were dead,
then that you had risen from the dead.  So, I congratulate
you, most happy that no need exists for condolences
to anyone.  Padre Osuna, here is the bark."
</p>

<p>
Juan Antonio took the bark and laid it on a table
by the bed of the friar.
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks, señor, for your goodness.  As head
of this Mission of San José I accept the gift from
Señor Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza laughed pleasantly.  "Then, reverend
señor, as administrator of this Mission of San José, I
offer a little gift of Jesuit bark to the spiritual leader
of the vicinity."
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza, I can recognize no administrator
of these mission lands, save one, and that is I, Padre
Lusciano Osuna.  My Franciscan brethren rescued this
country from wilderness and its people from savagery.
This Mexican government of yours then comes, takes
away two thirds of the land and its appurtenances, and
gives it to you and to others who accept it and hold it.
By government sanction you administer, Señor Mendoza;
but, I hold, unjustly.  Never by word or act
shall I acknowledge your authority in this valley of
Santa Clara."
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza smiled.  His equanimity was not
easily upset.
</p>

<p>
"Good reverend padre, hear me.  Your fathers did,
indeed, redeem this country and its savage tribes.  A
mighty work surely has been done.  But, because of
freeing the natives from paganism, should you hold this
vast province in fee simple?  Is it right that a score
of monks should own the land from San Diego to Yerba
Buena?  The friars still possess more land than they
can either occupy or cultivate&mdash;but I ask your pardon
for talking thus long when you are ill.  I trust the
Jesuit bark will not fail of its customary happy effect."
</p>

<p>
"Your wish is generous, Señor Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"Just one short word more.  I would like to thank
you deeply, in the name of my neighbors and myself, for
your work in quieting the Indians the day of your
return from San Joaquin valley.  I doubt not your
coming meant more than many of us realize."
</p>

<p>
"I simply fulfilled the duties of my position.
Nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"Good-day, Padre Lusciano.  I hope your good
health will soon return."
</p>

<p>
The Administrator departed.
</p>

<p>
"Shut the door, Juan.  I feel I may sleep.  Go forth
to your duties.  When I awake I will call you.  Go,
now, while sleep is heavy on my eyelids."
</p>

<p>
Juan Antonio went to the door.  Hesitating a moment
he turned, with: "Reverend father, shall I not prepare
a draught of the bark which Señor Mendoza left for
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Go forth to your duties, man.  I can accept no gift
from Señor Mendoza if the acceptance implies acknowledgment
of his administratorship.  I will return him his
Jesuit bark.  The call of principle is higher than the
claim of bodily health."
</p>

<p>
The major-domo closed the door.  Sleep came to the
friar.
</p>

<p>
The Mission buildings were constructed in accordance
with the architecture in vogue in California at that
time.  Buildings formed three sides of an inclosure, a
courtyard gate and wall the fourth.  On one side were
housed the unmarried Indian women.  Across the deep
courtyard lived the single men.  The third row of
structures gave home to the major-domo, the chief
vaquero, or herdsman, and the families of each.  Under
the same roof with these latter were the shops of the
carpenters, the blacksmiths, and the various other
artisans of the Mission.  This side of the square opened
into the freedom of the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
A man came to the carpenter shop and stepped
within.  "Is the padre here?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
The master carpenter replied, "Our padre is ill."
</p>

<p>
"I have most important letters which should be
delivered to him in person."
</p>

<p>
"Go then, to the major-domo."
</p>

<p>
The newcomer walked toward Juan Antonio.  In his
dress the man was the ordinary traveler of the day.
Tanned-skin shirt and trousers, shaggy leggings and
wide hat, distinguished him in no manner from a dozen
other wayfarers who, between dawn and night, might
come on some quest to the Mission.
</p>

<p>
The deep-set, gleaming eyes of the old Indian
surveyed him from foot to crown.  He saw a man in the
prime of life, his face parched by tropical sun to the
color of leather.  A military mustache was on his lip.
</p>

<p>
"You wish to see me?" asked Juan Antonio.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to see Padre Lusciano.  I have letters
introducing me to him."
</p>

<p>
"The padre is firmly held by fever-and-ague.  Little
strength is left to him.  If you will, I'll carry your
letters to him.  I'm going to see him now.  You rest,
while I'm gone, in the porter's lodge; or, if you like,
go over to Señor Mendoza's property across the way."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, many.  I'll wait in the lodge.  Here are the
letters."
</p>

<p>
The major-domo disappeared into the padre's quarters.
Soon he was again at the stranger's side.
</p>

<p>
"Padre Lusciano says come."
</p>

<p>
He followed the Indian through alcove and corridor
to the friar's bedroom.
</p>

<p>
"Your name is Captain Farquharson, I learn.  Juan
Antonio, a chair for this brother.  Seat yourself, good
sir.  Now," to the Indian, "close the door and stay not
far away.  I'll call you when I want you."
</p>

<p>
They were a short time in earnest conversation.
</p>

<p>
The stranger opened the door to leave.
</p>

<p>
"Antonio," called the padre.  The Indian came
quickly.  "Conduct my visitor outside, then return."
</p>

<p>
Major-domo and caller passed through the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
"Amar Dios!" the Indian said at parting.
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks for your attention," from the other.
</p>

<p>
Juan Antonio returned to the friar's room.
</p>

<p>
"Take these letters and lock them in my desk there.
Bring me the key.  Good.  Now, attend carefully to
what I say."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Señor Padre."
</p>

<p>
"Tell no one the name of the man whom you have
just escorted out."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be as you say, Reverend Padre."
</p>

<p>
"It is well.  The giant, ambition, stirs in his sleep.
Soon he awakes and moves to action."  Then, in half
aside: "Mexico has wrought the undoing of our missions.
If a chance of retrieval comes why should I not&mdash;but
Misericordia!"
</p>

<p>
A great cheering was heard in the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
"Go, see the cause, and come and tell me, Antonio."
</p>

<p>
"Glorious news!" the Indian hastening back.  "Pedro
Carrasca returns from Monterey two hours before the
time, and has an abundance of Jesuit bark in his
saddlebags.  More yet, good padre.  A messenger from Dario.
He is the third messenger sent&mdash;Yoscolo and Stanislaus
must have captured the others.  Dario has driven our
herds far into the valley of the San Joaquin River;
and, the man says, soon will they fat for the matanza"
(the killing).
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well, Juan.  Bring me a portion of the bark,
then I'll rest a little.  In the chapel to-night pray
fervently for rain, and thank God for his mercies; and ask
him to avert war and bloodshed from our province
here, and from the whole world.  Shut the door now.
Carry my blessing to the children when they are
assembled for evening prayer."
</p>

<p>
The door closed and the major-domo went about his
many tasks.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br />
THE MERIENDA
</h3>

<p>
"Daughter mine, awake!  'Tis the day of the
merienda."
</p>

<p>
"I'm up, little papa."
</p>

<p>
A rasp of file on flint was heard as she struck a light.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh-oo-oo! the water's cold."
</p>

<p>
The old don laughed.  "Cold water drives the sands
of sleep from the eyelids, child."
</p>

<p>
He walked along the corridor to his sitting room.
The large time-piece showed four o'clock and three
minutes.  Five minutes later his daughter joined him,
clad in tanned-skin blouse and skirt, with a straw
sombrero on her head.
</p>

<p>
"Here I am, papacito.  Is breakfast ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Breakfast waits, but the coming of the morning
waits not."
</p>

<p>
The peons served them by candlelight.
</p>

<p>
Soon they were ready for the start.
</p>

<p>
Before the courtyard gate were the doña's carreta,
the señor's horse, and a squad of mounted fighting
peons.  Servants placed soft tule grass in the carreta,
lambwool comforters, for greater ease in riding.
</p>

<p>
In double file marched the mounted peon soldiers, the
carreta between, while the lord of the hacienda rode by
his daughter's side.  Thus they reached the plaza of the
village near the Mission San José.
</p>

<p>
The place was alive with carretas bearing mothers,
dueñas, and daughters, with caballeros, with bustling
peons and early-risen Indian children.
</p>

<p>
Lanterns were strung around the square, in the
middle of which blazed a big bonfire.  The caballeros
capered their horses before the carretas.  The señoritas
applauded by "Brava!  Brava!" or shrieked at some
unusually daring equestrian feat.
</p>

<p>
Captain Moranda was early at the plaza.  Many a
señorita turned her glance from adventurous youth and
cavorting horse to the soldier in trig uniform, whose
steed was frequently by the side of Doña Carmelita's
carreta.
</p>

<p>
Preparations were now under way for the setting-out.
Each carreta now had four horses, tandem, a
postilion mounting the wheel animal of each team.
</p>

<p>
"Sunlight on the peak!" intoned a peon stationed on
a rooftop.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza, in charge of the affair, looked
carefully over the carretas arranged longitudinally, the
caballeros around them, and the fighting peons armed
with carbine and saber.  "Adelante!" he shouted and
galloped away at the head of the cavalcade.
</p>

<p>
The carretas surged forward.  At the end of an hour,
half way up the mountain, Mendoza gave a command
to halt.
</p>

<p>
The eastern sky was rosy.  The morning star still
shone undimmed though all others had retired.  The
cañon facing the procession was hidden in purple
twilight, while the mountain peak blazed like some glory
throne.  The joyful men and women became silent
before the majesty.
</p>

<p>
In the valley the light was chasing the shadows up
the hills.  These shadows were flying to the picnickers
as if for protection, when, lo! the sun was on the eastern
horizon.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza signaled Captain Morando, who chanted the
opening line of Saint Francis of Assisi's "Canticle to
the Sun."
</p>

<p>
Tongue after tongue caught up the words.  The
Indians, who had been taught singing and knew well
the music of the church, united with the others, and
the swell of five hundred voices rolled over valley and
hill.
</p>

<p>
"O, most high, Almighty, good Lord, to thee belong
the praise, honor, and all blessings:
</p>

<p>
"Praised be our Lord, for our brother the wind, and
for air and cloud, calms and all weather, by the which
thou upholdest in life all creatures.
</p>

<p>
"Praised be my Lord for our sister water, who is
very serviceable unto us, and humble, and precious,
and clean.
</p>

<p>
"Praised be my Lord for our brother fire, through
whom thou givest us light in the darkness; and he is
bright, and pleasant, and very mighty and strong.
</p>

<p>
"Praised be my Lord for our mother the earth, the
which doth sustain us and keep us, and bringeth forth
divers fruits and flowers of many colors, and grass."
</p>

<p>
"Adelante!" again called Mendoza, and once more
they were off.  The odor of pine reached them at one
height; at another the resinous redwood, in mammoth
groves, pointed skyward.  The señoritas and caballeros
talked, laughed, sang, and perhaps mildly flirted.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock they reached the entrance to the
cañon which marked the beginning of Calaveras Valley.
Vast tangles of blackberry bushes were everywhere,
creeping up the cañon side, festooning projecting rocks,
climbing trees, ivylike, and dropping their branches
dark with ripening fruit.  Tinkling rills ran along,
unaffected by the drought.  Colonies of birds floated in
the air, sang in the trees, or, fluttering around the
vines, ate their fill.
</p>

<p>
From time immemorial these grounds had been carefully
guarded from everyone till the merienda day at
close of spring, on which occasion the first fruits were
gathered by the land barons and their select company,
with feasting, dancing, and merrymaking.
</p>

<p>
After that day all embargo was removed, and the
products of the valley were free to all.
</p>

<p>
According to custom the señorita whose carriage
first reached the merienda ground was queen of the day,
and an early-California chariot race occurred yearly
here.
</p>

<p>
Down the inclined way the carretas went, toward the
bottom of the valley where the choicest berries grew.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza wheeled his horse and gave the command
to stop.  "We rest a few minutes.  Then, let the
carretas which compete in the race range themselves as
will be directed, and start at the word."
</p>

<p>
Pedro Zelaya and Fulgencio Higuera were appointed
judges.
</p>

<p>
Carreta after carreta drew forward.  Soon a score
or more were side by side, to enter the contest.
</p>

<p>
The judges were busy moving one team forward,
another back.  When all were at equal advantage the
stalwart Higuera called:
</p>

<p>
"Make ready!  Run!"
</p>

<p>
Away they went, the caballeros fringing the sides, the
other carretas trailing in the rear.  Weeks of patient
labor of the peons had made the course even and smooth.
</p>

<p>
"Now!  Now!" cried Hernandez.  "I'll show Mendoza
my Mexican imported horseflesh is superior to his
Californians.  Boy," to the postilion, "taut with the
reins, and ready with the whip!"
</p>

<p>
"Hoop-la!  Hoop-la!" the drivers shouted to their
straining teams, the long whiplashes curling from their
hands and touching the splendid animals in stinging
crack, while the caballeros admonished or encouraged.
</p>

<p>
"The spur on the wheeler, Miguel!  The lash on that
leader!" or, "Grande!  Grande!  Martino.  Another
such spurt and you win!"
</p>

<p>
Lolita Hernandez, Alfreda Castro and Carmelita
Mendoza were ahead.  For a minute the three carretas
ran neck and neck.
</p>

<p>
Marcel Hernandez, father of Lolita, rode by her
team.  In the enthusiasm of the moment he urged the
horses with his riding-whip and joined with the
postilions in shouting, "Hoop-la!  Hoop-la!"
</p>

<p>
Patricio Martinez, Alfreda's long-time cavalier,
hovered near her, shouting: "Now's your chance, Diego!
Stir up that pinto!  Ease the bit on that sorrel!  Go
it, my beauties!"
</p>

<p>
The Doña Carmelita's peon had a cool head, driving
so as to draw from the other racers their best speed.
Little by little he lessened the swiftness of his own horses,
allowing the others to forge ahead.
</p>

<p>
The Hernandez Mexicans and the Castro Andalusians
held their own, side by side, as if in double
harness.  For more than a hundred paces it seemed neither
one gained nor lost a hairbreadth.  Suddenly the Castro
animals winded.  High-stepping and proud, they gradually
lost.  Magnificent in their defeat they fell back.
</p>

<p>
"Huzza!  Huzza!" yelled Hernandez.  "I knew I
breed the best stock in the valley.  My daughter shall
be queen of the fiesta."
</p>

<p>
Then Carmelita's peon gave rein to his horses.  They
sprang from the ground and rushed onward.  For an
instant the two carretas ran together, each splendid
horse, straight-backed, ears low, nostrils distended,
striking his feet in unison with his fellows.  Soon the
Hernandez team began to slip backward foot by foot.
</p>

<p>
"Diablo!  Diablo!" thundered Hernandez.  "Peon,
urge your horses!  Use the whip!"
</p>

<p>
The Hernandez Indian dug his spurs into his mount,
and cruelly flayed the leaders.
</p>

<p>
The other carreta yet more quickly moved ahead.
Already the Mendoza wheeler was abreast the
Hernandez leader.
</p>

<p>
Above the roar of the vehicles sounded the plaudits
of the caballeros.
</p>

<p>
"Viva!  Viva, Mendoza!  Viva the California horses!
Viva the Señorita Mendoza!"
</p>

<p>
A stone the size of a walnut caught in the hind shoe
of Mendoza's wheeler.  The steady pace of his horses
broke.
</p>

<p>
The Hernandez animals pressed on.
</p>

<p>
"Swing out, boy, swing out!  Sweep in from the
side!" exulted Hernandez.  "Victory for the Mexican
horses!"
</p>

<p>
The driver turned his team.  "Bueno, boy, bueno!
Now straight ahead!  Loose the rein!  Let 'em go!"
</p>

<p>
The Mendoza postilion bent affectionately over his
horse.  "Fly, Mercurio!  Fly! for the doña's sake!"
</p>

<p>
He unstrung his whiplash.  It burned the leaders with
living fire.  They leaped forward, the tremendous stride
flinging the pebbles from the wheeler's hoof.
</p>

<p>
Along the roadway the horses sped, lessening the
Hernandez advantage at every bound.  After them
poured the yelling, gesticulating crowd.
</p>

<p>
A hundred paces only remained.
</p>

<p>
The shouting ceased, the tenseness of the moment
closing every throat.
</p>

<p>
The Mendoza carreta overtook the other, passed it,
and reached the goal two lengths ahead.  Carmelita
was the queen of the day!
</p>

<p>
With a flourish the Doña Carmelita's postilion drew
up before the pavilion at the merienda ground, Mendoza
and Captain Morando assisting the breathless, excited
girl to alight.
</p>

<p>
Caballero and carreta whirled into the open space
around her.
</p>

<p>
"Hail!  Hail, to the queen of the merienda!" arose
on all sides.  She bowed right and left in acknowledgment.
</p>

<p>
On one side of the building stood a dais whence the
queen ruled her loyal subjects.
</p>

<p>
"Come, little one," her father said.  "Your ladies
of honor will accompany you to your throne."
</p>

<p>
Lolita and Alfreda walked with her to the dais, then
curtsied in deference.
</p>

<p>
"Your wishes, queen of the merienda?" they asked.
</p>

<p>
"For one hour let matron, maid, and man gather
blackberries for the feast.  Then all shall come to
luncheon in the pavilion, not forgetting to bring the
fruits of their labor.  For the afternoon my command
is that all enjoy themselves to the full."
</p>

<p>
Thus briefly spoke the ruler of the day; after which
she took her willow basket and hastened to gather
berries, as did her maids of honor and everyone else.
</p>

<p>
The appointed time saw all assembled near the feast
tables which had been made ready by the peons.  Heaping
dishes of berries were conspicuous among a variety
and abundance of viands.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo, commander of the presidio at
Monterey, with his wife and her younger sister, the
Señora Valentino, rode up on horseback.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel and his wife were well known to the
picnickers.  His sister-in-law had but lately arrived
from Madrid.
</p>

<p>
The newcomers were accorded a gracious reception.
</p>

<p>
"Happened to be visiting near San José.  Hearing
of the merienda, we came along without an invitation,"
said Barcelo, laughing.  "Besides, I wished Señora
Valentino to witness one of our festal days.  It is
unique.  Madrid itself holds nothing to equal it."
</p>

<p>
The brown eyes of the lady from Madrid flashed in
accompaniment to her pearly teeth.  "Rare things have
I seen in California in the fortnight I am here."
</p>

<p>
"In a moment luncheon is served.  My worthy Barcelo,
I invite you and your party to our table.  My
daughter and a few others sit with us.  Come, friends,"
spoke Señor Mendoza, true to the unbounded hospitality
of the California grandee.
</p>

<p>
A peon sounded a gong.  The hungry merienda folk
lost little time in coming to the meal.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza was at the head of his table, Doña
Carmelita at the foot.  At the host's right and left
were seated Colonel Barcelo and his wife; Señora
Valentino, by his sister.  The ladies of honor, with
Hernandez, who sat by his daughter, filled the other places,
except one.  This had been reserved for Morando, who
now came up.
</p>

<p>
"An accident to one of the horsemen detained me for
the past half hour," was his explanation to Señor Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"A caballero's misfortune always calls for assistance
from a brother," replied Mendoza.  Continuing:
"Captain Morando, I wish to introduce you to Señora
Valentino, who favors us to-day by her presence with
her relatives, the Barcelos.  Señora Valentino, may I
present Captain Moranda?"
</p>

<p>
The señora acknowledged pleasantly the Captain's
low bow.
</p>

<p>
"Captain, to your chair," from Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
Conversation lulled for a little.  Early hours and
open air had given zest to the appetite.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Señora Valentino, I wish you could have
seen our carreta race this morning," remarked Señor
Mendoza.  "But it will not be the last."
</p>

<p>
"While I say nothing against the race of this morning
as such," interposed Hernandez, "for it was good
enough as far as it went, I do claim that my horses
were better than yours, Mendoza.  Your peon rider
happened to be more at home in his business than was
mine, nothing more.  I wish I had been in that postilion's
place myself; then there would have been a different
story to tell."
</p>

<p>
"A horse can display but the swiftness his limbs
possess," rebutted Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Riding is not what I knew in my youth," commented
Hernandez, who was giving ample appreciation to the
pleasures of the table.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Morando, were you not at a ball given in
Madrid last year by the officers of General Guerrero's
division in their quarters?" said Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"I was, indeed.  And now, señora, I remember you
well.  Strange I did not recall you at first."
</p>

<p>
"The fact that I was in ball-dress then and in riding-habit
now is, undoubtedly, what prevented you from
recognizing me before."
</p>

<p>
"Why, we have old friends here!" interjected Colonel
Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
"How is Colonel Valentino, your husband?"
</p>

<p>
"Shortly after that ball of which we speak my husband
was ordered to service in Morocco, and there he
laid down his life for his country."
</p>

<p>
"I regret that my question called up sad memories.
Nearly a year have I been away from Madrid, and
news travels slowly to us here.  I offer to you my
sympathy in your great loss."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind, Lieutenant&mdash;I should say, 'Captain'
Morando.  But&mdash;what is past is gone.  It is well,
then, to forget.  A wonderful life these Californians
live!"
</p>

<p>
"I trust Colonel Barcelo and his lady will find
opportunity while in this vicinity to bring you, señora,
to visit us at our home in Mission San José.  What
says my daughter?"
</p>

<p>
The Doña Carmelita cordially seconded her father's
invitation.  The Barcelos accepted; the Señora
Valentino likewise.
</p>

<p>
"Mission San José&mdash;Mission San José&mdash;" mused
the latter.  "Is there not living there a Franciscan friar,
one Lusciano Osuna?"
</p>

<p>
"It is so," assented Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"I heard he was in California, and as you mentioned
the Mission San José it came to me that was given as
his present home."
</p>

<p>
"A man of some importance, probably, in Spain,"
volunteered Señor Hernandez.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know him personally," replied Señora
Valentino.  "In the cathedral of Barcelona I heard him
give the Lenten sermons several years ago.  It was
quite shortly after his ordination, but his discourses
possessed rare charm and power.  The city was literally
at his feet."
</p>

<p>
"Strange such a man comes here as a mission padre?"
observed Hernandez.
</p>

<p>
"It was his request.  Some unknown powerful influence
seconded him, else Spain would not have lost her
great preacher."
</p>

<p>
At that moment the strains of the grand march
floated through the pavilion, from the excellent
orchestra provided for the dancing.
</p>

<p>
Captain Morando was quickly at Doña Carmelita's
side.  "Señorita the Doña Mendoza, may I claim your
favor for the grand march and the waltz following?"
</p>

<p>
It was granted.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita and Morando were at once circling in the
waltz.
</p>

<p>
"I still have the rose which fell to me from the sky
one moonlit night a month ago."
</p>

<p>
"Does it keep so long?" mischievously.
</p>

<p>
"It is pressed in a book of poems.  Each couplet of
book-leaves holds a petal.  The odor of the petals
speaks to me the same thought which is the subject
of these poems.  Shall I tell you what it is,
Señorita Doña?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! the music ceases.  Lead me to a resting
place."
</p>

<p>
There was to be no resting for Señorita Mendoza.
Importunate youths claimed dance after dance.
</p>

<p>
The elders, men and women, were scattered around
in groups, some looking at the dancing, others
conversing, a few playing cards.
</p>

<p>
Señor Valentino, owing to her recent bereavement,
did not dance.  She seated herself on a rustic bench
beneath a widespread sycamore, where she was soon
the center of an interested coterie.  The lady so recently
from Madrid retailed to Spanish-born gentry the news
of the distant imperial city.
</p>

<p>
After a while Captain Morando came up.  Soon the
two were in animated conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Captain, not on the floor!  Foot-weary so
soon?" spoke a dueña who now joined them.
</p>

<p>
"No, señora, not foot-weary.  I forego for a time
the pleasures of the dance that I may listen to the
words of our beautiful visitor here."
</p>

<p>
He made a low bow to Señora Valentino, who laughingly
extended her hand to him.  He bent sweepingly
over it, barely touching the ends of her fingers with
his.
</p>

<p>
"The Señor Captain Morando!" a man's voice called
at his elbow.  It was Abelardo Peralta.  The music and
dancing had stopped.  The guests were assembling
around the dais on which was seated Doña Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"Our queen demands your presence, Señor Captain,"
Peralta went on.
</p>

<p>
The Captain was shortly before her majesty the
queen of the fiesta.
</p>

<p>
"The games are about to begin, Captain Morando.
Do you not remember that I appointed you and Don
Abelardo to define the boundaries of the racing course,
and to determine the various goals?  Also please to
remind the Señora Valentino that she is requested to
crown the victors."
</p>

<p>
As the afternoon waned the interest in the athletic
events increased.  The footraces for young men showed
that the sons of the province were nimble of limb, and
won the approbation of Pedro Zelaya himself, whose
swiftness was credited with being only less than a
fast-galloping horse.
</p>

<p>
The señoritas ran a shorter course very creditably.
</p>

<p>
Then came a contest of knife-throwing in which the
men of the period were wonderfully proficient.  The
knife was flung, blade extended, from the palm of the
hand with such force that the point of the weapon would
sink several inches into a wooden target placed twenty,
thirty, or more, paces away.
</p>

<p>
"Hoop-la!  Hoop-la!" came through a cloud of dust.
A number of vaqueros had driven a wild steer from the
mountains to the race course.  The picnickers looked
at the animal from their safe position on the platform.
Again and again the creature charged at the vaqueros,
who deftly swung their horses out of harm's way.
</p>

<p>
"Send him here!" some young fellow called to one of
the herdsmen.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," another cried, "send him over this way to me."
</p>

<p>
The animal pawed the earth, bellowed, and rushed
around the race course in fury.
</p>

<p>
Don Pedro Zelaya climbed out on a projecting tree-branch
and dropped on the animal's back, in the midst
of one of its mad careenings.  It stood stock still for
a moment in bewilderment.  Zelaya's sharp spurs soon
stirred it into action.  It ran, leaped, even bucked like
a broncho, in trying to rid its back of the burden, but
in vain.
</p>

<p>
"Brava!  Brava!  Señor Zelaya.  Soon will you have
another gentle pony."
</p>

<p>
"Let him chase thee around the race course," yelled
a youth.  "One hundred pesos to fifty he catches
thee!"
</p>

<p>
Zelaya found time to wave his acknowledgment of the
persiflage.
</p>

<p>
The steer suddenly tried rolling over and over to free
itself.  The man sprang to the ground each time it
dashed itself down; then, with the litheness of a cat,
leaped to its back as it arose.
</p>

<p>
The animal finally gave up all efforts to throw the
rider, and ran at full speed around the racing track,
amidst the loud plaudits of the assembly.
</p>

<p>
Señor Zelaya drew himself back into the branches of
the tree, after a little, and his mount escaped to the
forest.
</p>

<p>
The men exhibited all manner of fancy riding.  Some
rode at the flank of a horse at gallop, or under the
belly, or astride the neck.  Others leaned from their
saddles in flying sweep and picked up coins from the
ground; or drew from the sand chickens buried to the
head, yet so gentle the rider's hand that the fowl was
not in the least injured.
</p>

<p>
The shadows come early in the deep cañons.  The
queen sent her messengers to call the people around her
throne while the winners received their prizes.
Abelardo Peralta announced, in her name, that after the
distribution luncheon would again be served in the
pavilion.
</p>

<p>
"Our queen makes Don Abelardo her chief courtier,"
remarked Lolita Hernandez in the hearing of a number.
</p>

<p>
"They have been friends since childhood, Señorita
Lolita," returned this young lady's dueña.
</p>

<p>
Lolita laughed mirthlessly.  "I fancy the captain
from Madrid has offended.  Perhaps her majesty saw
him kissing Señora Valentino's hand this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Fie!  Fie!" from another dueña.  "He touched only
the tip of that lady's fingers with his own.  I saw it
myself."
</p>

<p>
"Diffident soldier!" from a grave señor.  "In my
youth I would not have been content with so slight a
token."
</p>

<p>
"Manuel!  Manuel!" from his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Moraga, thy husband thinks on his courtship
of thee," spoke yet another dueña, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure it looked as if the Captain kissed the
stranger lady's hand," Lolita reiterated.  "I'm sure too
Carmelita saw it, for we were dancing in the same set
when it happened."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas but a lady's favor and a man's privilege,
little one," said Moraga.
</p>

<p>
"Manuel!  Manuel!" again from his wife.  "And
before such a child as Lolita!"
</p>

<p>
"I know Carmelita favored Captain Morando above
Don Abelardo the day of the dinner at her father's
house.  I saw it, and so did all the girls.  I know she
changed toward him to-day after what I&mdash;saw.  I know
she did."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino approached the group.
</p>

<p>
At almost the same moment Morando came up from
the opposite direction, having been at the race course
collecting from the judges their decisions as to the
victors.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Captain mine, bearest thou a word for beauty
as well as for prowess in athletics?" questioned Moraga.
</p>

<p>
"The queen has appointed no judge of beauty.  Even
the wisest would find bewilderment here where all are
so fair," replied the gallant Morando.
</p>

<p>
"Our Captain is a diplomat," smiled the señora.
She bowed to the gentleman in question; he yet lower
to her.
</p>

<p>
A messenger advanced, saying with much ceremony:
"Señora Valentino, the queen requests you to crown
the winners from the dais.  Captain Morando, you are
commanded before the throne there to read your reports."
</p>

<p>
The señora curtsied.  "My sovereign's will is mine."
</p>

<p>
The soldier saluted, but before he could make speech
Mendoza's hand was on his shoulder.  "Pardon me,
friends, I have a word with the Captain."
</p>

<p>
"Morando," said the old don when they were apart,
"you may not know the keen instincts of our wild
animals for change in weather.  Bear and mountain lion
are hurrying through the forest here back to the high
mountains.  During the drought they have been under
foot, tame as dogs.  My fighting peons brought me
word of this sudden activity of the animals, and just
now I observed it for myself.  It means the quick
coming of a storm."
</p>

<p>
"Maldito!  is it sure?  Leagues from home are we and
scores of women folk with us."
</p>

<p>
"To make doubly sure I rode my horse to the summit
of a high bluff.  The clouds are rolling hitherward in
masses black and angry."
</p>

<p>
"What, think you, we would better do?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll order the peons to bring out the carretas and
saddle the horses.  'Twill be a few minutes only.  Then
I'll call for silence and ask all to take conveyance or
mount, speaking of imminent storm in such way as not
to give unnecessary alarm.  For myself, I'll lead my
fighting peons; let come next the carretas; then marshal
you the caballeros."
</p>

<p>
As said so was it done.
</p>

<p>
Soon all was in readiness, and the procession was
tearing over the road by which it had come early in the
day.  Doña Carmelita had given her carreta to Señora
Valentino, while she rode with her dueña.  Provision
was also made for Señora Barcelo, Mendoza declaring
it unsafe for a woman to ride horseback under the
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
As they sped along darkness overtook them.  Intermittent
lightning darted forked tongues across the sky,
while thunder pealed and reverberated.  The pent-up
rain of months poured on the returning picnickers.
In the dry creek-beds streams arose even while they
were crossing.
</p>

<p>
The dueña's carreta was somewhat slower than the
others and thus was last in the line.  Morando rode by
Carmelita's side.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the heavens seemed to split.  Torrents of
water roared on the hillside, inundated the roadway,
and poured over carretas and horsemen.
</p>

<p>
There had been a cloud-burst.
</p>

<p>
A heavy boulder whirling in the flood was flung
against Morando's horse.  As it fell caballeros close by
grasped bridle-rein and stirrup-strap and drew the
animal to its feet.  Panic-stricken it dashed wildly
forward.
</p>

<p>
The lightning ceased.  The dense blackness but
increased the confusion.
</p>

<p>
The carretas floundered in the water.  Finally, all
save one fought their way to higher ground.  A projecting
tree-limb had struck the dueña's postilion.  His
horse slipped beneath him and turned with the
turbulent current.  Man, horses, carreta, and occupants
were washed down the declivity.
</p>

<p>
The caballeros, unknowing, struggled on.
</p>

<p>
The dueña's horses soon found footing on the hillside,
and taking the bits in their teeth ran headlong
down grade into the deep cañon.
</p>

<p>
When Carmelita recovered consciousness she was
lying in a cave, on some bear skins, near a glowing fire
of logs.  She could hear horses stamping and eating.
Her dueña, still unconscious, was on another pile of skins.
</p>

<p>
A man came from the darkness and stood by her.
He was dressed in tanned-skin shirt and trousers, and
in his hand he held a sombrero.  The mustached face
was burned brown in the sun.
</p>

<p>
He noticed that Carmelita had opened her eyes.
"Neither of you is seriously injured.  I am physician
enough to determine that.  Rest here quietly till
morning, and doubtless your friends will come.  I'll have
some one prepare you a hot drink now."  This he spoke
in Spanish.  Then in English, as he turned away:
"Queerest product of a spring freshet I ever saw!"
</p>

<p>
He chuckled at his own conceit.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br />
A NIGHT SPENT IN A CAVE
</h3>

<p>
"The drink is ready.  Will I bring it to the ladies
now, Cap'?"
</p>

<p>
These words awakened Doña Carmelita from a sound
sleep into which she had fallen despite the discomfiture
of rain-soaked clothes.  The fire was burning brightly,
and she found herself nearer the blaze whither some
one, without awakening her, had drawn the pile of skins
on which she was lying.  The warmth had nearly dried
her clothing.
</p>

<p>
The dueña had recovered from her swooning, and was
partially sitting up endeavoring to collect her senses.
</p>

<p>
"The drink is ready, Cap'.  Will you ask the ladies
if they want it?  I don't know a word of their lingo."
</p>

<p>
The man touched his hat in military style.  The one
denominated "Cap'" came up, he who had spoken to
Carmelita a little previously.
</p>

<p>
"My man here has prepared some strong black coffee
for you.  An allowance of the native spirit you call
'aguardiente' has been added.  I advise you both to
drink freely of the mixture.  Blankets will be provided
you, and you will sleep here safe and warm till morning.
Will you have the beverage now?  I trust you feel
not greatly any effect of the unusual experience which
must have been yours."
</p>

<p>
"O!" moaned the dueña, now coming somewhat more
to herself.  "What a terrible happening!  I expected
each instant to be killed.  O! where am I?"
</p>

<p>
The man laughed.  "I cannot discuss what occurred
to you before we found you outside this cave.  Neither
can I tell you where you are, for I know only in a vague
way the location of the place.  Let it suffice that you
are safe here.  Now, warm yourself with this drink and
seek to sleep.  The morning brings, doubtless, searchers
for you."
</p>

<p>
The man who seemed the leader had been speaking in
Spanish.  A trace of foreign accent was in each word,
though he spoke the language fluently and correctly.
</p>

<p>
The other man broke in with:
</p>

<p>
"Coffee's cooling fast, Cap'.  If they don't take it
now, I'll have to heat it up again all over.  Kiyi that
to 'em in their own lingo.  Wish I knew how to."
</p>

<p>
He had been standing holding in one hand a steaming
saucepan, in the other an improvised wooden tray on
which were two metal goblets.
</p>

<p>
The Señorita Carmelita struggled with some difficulty
to a sitting position.
</p>

<p>
"We thank you for your thoughtfulness," she said.
</p>

<p>
"The young lady says she won't have the mess&mdash;is
that it, Cap'?" asked the man holding the saucepan
and goblets.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita was about to reply in English, but the
leader said, quickly: "Give them your preparation
there, Brown.  Don't be slow.  They should have had
it drunk by this time."
</p>

<p>
Brown complied with the order.
</p>

<p>
The woman and the girl sipped the steaming liquid.
</p>

<p>
"Now I remember," said the dueña.  "We left the
road just after that awful thunder clap.  The water
washed us down and down.  Then my horses ran and ran,
downhill, over rocks and gullies&mdash;O it was awful!"
covering her face with her hands.  "Then came the
crash; and I really knew no more until this moment.
Thank you, sirs, for this," sipping the black coffee.
"It shall be no loss, and I will see you have ample
reward.  Besides, this señorita here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is the old lady saying she wants another swig?"
interrupted the man holding the saucepan.  "Because
if she's still thirsty, there's more of this coffee and
aggydenty right here," shaking the contents of the
vessel, "and if this ain't plenty I can manyfactur
more."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Brown!" spoke the other.  "If you have
anything more to do I'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you say," agreed the other, unperturbed.
</p>

<p>
"The crash you tell of brought my man here and
myself out to where the accident met you.  Your vehicle
had struck a huge rock which forms one side of this
cave.  Needless to say the carriage was in kindling
wood.  You," to the dueña, "and the young lady had
been thrown entirely free from the melee into a thick
bed of dried leaves&mdash;or leaves that had been dry before
the rain," this with a smile.  "Your horses were
floundering in the mud."
</p>

<p>
"O, my brave, beautiful horses!" exclaimed the dueña.
"Where are they?  O, where are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Safe here with my own horses and quietly eating
fodder as if nothing had occurred.  Your Indian driver
came off with a broken shoulder.  He sleeps now
farther along in the cave.  I fancy the plentiful supply
of aguardiente my man Brown gave him aided in
producing his slumbers.  However, I knew no other way
to ease him."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that Luis!" said the dueña.  "I'll have him
whipped when he recovers for thus endangering us both
with his careless driving.  My regular driver is away
in the eastern grass ranges."
</p>

<p>
"Anything more I can do?" asked Brown.  "I hear
my name spoke of."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more.  I was telling the ladies you aided
their injured servant to sleep by a free supply of spirits.
You may go now."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you say, Cap'.  Said nigger servant of the
lady is a regler canal when it comes to aggydenty,"
commented Brown as he betook himself and saucepan
away.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita and the dueña finished drinking the
contents of the goblets.  The man Brown soon came back
with two pairs of woolen blankets.
</p>

<p>
"These blankets are finest English wool.  Wrap up
in 'em and you'll find yourselves warm and dry by
morning.  Tell 'em, Cap', in their own talk."
</p>

<p>
"Brown, you may retire now to the inner cave and
sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you say, Cap'."
</p>

<p>
"I trust you will be as comfortable as the situation
permits.  Allow me to wish you pleasant dreams and
the hope that to-morrow will find you both none the
worse for this mishap.  Good-night."  The Captain
bowed.
</p>

<p>
Soon the Captain was gone and the dueña and the
girl were closely wrapped in the warm blankets.  The
fire still burned high and diffused a grateful heat.
A feeling of repose crept over both the women.  The
storm howled and raged outside, but in their wearied
state it was scarce less than a lullaby to them.  Numbness
came to their senses.  They slept in the wild cave,
safe from deluge and accident.
</p>

<p>
How long the Doña Carmelita had been sleeping she
knew not.  She opened her eyes.  The fire had burned
low.  The light of the embers was struggling with the
darkness.  Rain and wind still held high revel on the
outside.  The water swished and the tempest boomed
at the entrance of the cave.
</p>

<p>
Again she was sinking to slumber.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she roused.  Footsteps were near&mdash;unusual
footsteps, soft as air.  The fire was lower; the embers
cooling; darkness lay more completely over all.  Nearer
the sound came.  Every nerve was tense.  The fire gave
a feeble flicker.  By the wall of the cave two figures
stood not half a dozen paces from her.  They
disappeared suddenly.  She breathed more freely.  Another
flicker from the fire and she saw that they were
crouched low by the ground and apparently in
conversation.  A draft hurtled through the cavern and gave
life to the dying coals.  The two figures cast themselves
flat on the ground.  The embers died down.  Carmelita
waited in trepidation.
</p>

<p>
Another rift of light in answer to a current of air.
One of the prostrate figures was slowly moving toward
her, as a fish floats through water without apparent
movement or propulsion.  Never it hastened, yet never
it ceased to come, always nearer, without effort,
without pausing.
</p>

<p>
She shut her teeth and clenched her hands.  There
was a wild desire to scream, to call for help, to fly
out into the open.  She did none of these things.
The courage of her warrior forbears stood her in
stead.
</p>

<p>
All at once the body ceased its forward motion.
Then it moved backward, noiselessly, slowly.  It seemed
an age until it reached the other figure by the wall.
The overflow of the hurricane which now came sweeping
through the place invigorated the fire so that it showed
the two figures standing flush against the wall and
again in earnest consultation.  She could tell that they
were Indians, not by their dress, for that was indistinct,
but by their postures and gestures.  Suddenly they
were prone on the ground and going, again noiselessly,
toward the inner cave.
</p>

<p>
The wind ceased.  The fire decreased to half a dozen
separate sparks.  Darkness hid the Indians from her
eyes.  She reached out her hand to waken the dueña,
but desisted.
</p>

<p>
"Why frighten her?  Doubtless they are ordinary
peons seeking shelter from the storm."
</p>

<p>
After a while, through very exhaustion, she slept.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes opened wide almost with a snap and she sat
bolt upright.  A portion of the fire had been replenished
and was flaming up.  A low cry forced itself from her
lips before she recognized the one by the fire to be
Brown.  "What is it?" asked the girl.
</p>

<p>
The dueña awakened from heavy sleep.
</p>

<p>
"The horses&mdash;my horses," she cried, her wits still
half slumbering.  "The señor said they are safe.  What
a terrible thing&mdash;is the man still standing there?  I
trust his master will have the impertinent fellow
whipped."
</p>

<p>
Brown felt that some unusual explanation was due
from him, though he did not understand a word.  Bending
over, he placed his hands on his hips and spoke in
a mincing way, as if to children.
</p>

<p>
"Lady, people don't need be 'fraid of Injuns.  My
employer's all right&mdash;good man.  Injuns say much,
then I fight 'em.  Cap'n fight 'em&mdash;fight 'em like the
devil."
</p>

<p>
He balled his right hand and doubled the arm, then
patted the corded muscles approvingly with the fingers
of his left.  Finally he shook his fist in the direction of
the inner cave while his face assumed a mock-ferocious
expression.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he is threatening his kind master.  I'll
have my peons beat him soundly in the morning, if the
master wishes.  Fellow, begone! or I'll call the one who
owns you."
</p>

<p>
"Mamita, you mistake.  The man is saying not to
fear the Indians; that he and his Captain will protect
us."
</p>

<p>
"Fear the Indians!  Well, I should say not!  Besides,
there are no Indians here to fear, except that wretched
Luis who drove my horses, and he has a broken shoulder,
the scoundrel!  If you understand this creature,
child, tell him to be about his business before his master
learns of his annoying us."
</p>

<p>
"Old lady's scared, hey?  Scared out of her wits.
Well, I reckon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"She is not frightened, but I was a while ago when
two Indians were here and crept into the darkness,
after conducting themselves in the most mysterious
way."  The doña spoke in excellent English.
</p>

<p>
Extreme astonishment spread over Brown's features.
Then he looked as if his confidence had been painfully
abused.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I swanny!  Well, I swanny!  If this here don't
beat the deuce."
</p>

<p>
It was too much for him.  His hands sought his thighs
again, and he looked incredulously at the girl.
</p>

<p>
"If I do say it, this here beats the deuce!"
</p>

<p>
The man was of type the doña had never met before.
However, the humor of the situation came to her and
she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"The scamp is a fool, but that's nothing so unusual
as to amuse you so," snapped the dueña.  "I'm going
to try and sleep.  I'll let his master know of this.  I'd
have this fellow shut up on bread and water for ten
days, with several whippings for good measure.  Ah&mdash;h! these
wet clothes.  I'm glad we're safe, and the horses too."
</p>

<p>
She covered her eyes with the blanket to shut out the
firelight.
</p>

<p>
"Does the old lady ketch my talk?  I rather thought
she saw the joke."
</p>

<p>
"She understands no English."
</p>

<p>
"Mebbe not, but I speak plain United States.  It's
wonderful to meet one of you folks who knows how to
talk straight language."
</p>

<p>
The strangeness of the place and time did not prevent
Señorita Mendoza from again being amused.  "We
certainly speak language&mdash;the Spanish language."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I call 'lingo,' plain 'lingo.'  But that's
neither here nor there.  You talk American fine.  Of
course not as good as I do.  You couldn't expect that;
but I understand every word you say.
</p>

<p>
"My employer, I take it, is English," Brown went
on, "but he talks my talk all right&mdash;not as I do of
course.  I'm glad he's wise as he is that way, for
'ceptin' him, yourself included, I haven't conversed
with nobody for months.  A man naturally gets just
stale, homesick for folks and talking."
</p>

<p>
He seated himself comfortably by the fire, threw on
a dried branch or two, then, nursing one knee with his
hands clasped together, he looked at the girl.  Weeks
of unshaven stubble gave his face a grotesque appearance,
but Carmelita had a feeling of protection in the
presence and friendliness of this serving man.
</p>

<p>
"You speak of the other man as 'captain' and sometimes
as 'employer.'  That means he is your overseer,
does it not?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," in a puzzled way, "he pays me for my time,
and I do the work he cuts out for me.  That there
sums up the relations of me and Cap'n."
</p>

<p>
The dueña stirred in her sleep.  "My horses&mdash;&mdash;"
she muttered, then was quiet.
</p>

<p>
"Guess the old lady ain't restin' well.  P'raps she's
troubled with nightmare."
</p>

<p>
"No, I think she's worrying about her horses."
</p>

<p>
"Do say!  Mebbe they're all the poor creetur has."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyway, I hope she's got enough over and
above to buy herself another wagon."
</p>

<p>
"The lady here spoke a while ago of the other man
owning you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Own me!&mdash;like a nigger&mdash;not much!"
</p>

<p>
The leg he had been holding shot straight before
him.  Resting his palms beside him on the ground he
looked at the doña in mingled amazement and indignation.
</p>

<p>
"No man owns me, Miss&mdash;I dunno your name.  I'm
my own boss, beholding to no one save and except
Jehovah."  He swept one arm widely over his head, then
used it as a prop again.  "If the Cap'n here should try
to come it over me as master, why, decent feller that
he is, I'd chuck him body and bones out into the storm
right here and now.  My politics is, one man is good as
another if he behaves himself"&mdash;a revelation in
democracy to the doña.
</p>

<p>
"I greatly appreciate your coming to tell us not to
be frightened of those Indians.  Likely they only took
refuge from the storm, as did we."
</p>

<p>
Brown shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon they're guides to the big huntin' regions
east of here somewhere.  That's where we're bound
for, and that's why I shipped with the Cap'n
in the first place.  He's death on big game.  You
see," confidentially, "I'm a steamboater by profession.
Up and down the Mississippi's been my trick for
a dozen year.  Last fall followed a flock of prairie
schooners from Saint Joe to Santa Fé, largely for
diversion.  Met the Cap'n, and he was full of Californy
and huntin' grizzlies.  He wanted a man-of-all-work.
I wanted a job.  Here I be."
</p>

<p>
"Your life has been of great interest, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, I'll continue where I left off.  I was
asleep when the Injuns came.  They were talkin' mad-like
with the boss in lingo.  He gave it back to 'em in
lingo.  They p'inted out here where you be, and I took
it they were riled up about you folks.  The Cap'n
smoothed 'em off after a while.  I strolled along to tell
you some way not to be scared of the creeters, if
they'd growled at you when they came in.  Here I still
be."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you wish to sleep again now."
</p>

<p>
"Not any.  Horses all saddled to start.  We was
guided here by some Injun or other.  Found everything
here in plenty.  Never saw anything like it.  Reckon
when Cap'n is through in there we'll start somewhere.
He stops for no weather.  I'll foller where man can
lead."
</p>

<p>
Brown's flow of speech had left him talked out.  He
looked at the girl for a moment or two.  She sat with
the blanket around her and was studying him.
</p>

<p>
He finally asked:
</p>

<p>
"If I'm not infringin' on the idees you've been raised
by I'd like to ask how you come to know American?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"My father taught me English.  I cannot remember
when I did not speak it."
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Your pop's Spanish, I take it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He learned English first when among Englishmen
in the Napoleonic wars.  He even commanded an
English regiment for a time.  After the battle of
Talavera he led one of the divisions of the English army
off the field, every officer above him having been cut
down."
</p>

<p>
"My own pop fit in our war of 1812, about when
that Napoleon was raisin' old Scat.  My pop read all
about it.  Old gent's sixty-nine now.  Born in New
Hampshire was pop; mom in old Virginny.  They met
up in Missouria and married.  Here I be, as I notified
you before."
</p>

<p>
The girl did not make comment.
</p>

<p>
The fire died low.  Brown was busy with his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Three men came from within the inner cave.  Carmelita
lay back.  The dim light showed two of them to
be the Indians she had seen before, the third was
Brown's employer.  The Indians were plainly enraged.
The other's manner was suave and appeasing.  Their
conversation was animated, but, for a time, no distinct
word reached the girl.  The heavy guttural voices of the
natives contrasted strongly with the attempted soothing
tones of the white man.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be skeered, miss," whispered Brown.  "We
won't let 'em tech ye."
</p>

<p>
"Your palaver is useless, Sir Englishman," one of the
speakers said in a higher key than before.  "Cash in
the palm is your only argument with us."  The tone
was vibrant with passion.  He huddled his blanket
closely around his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Word and manner of the white man were smooth as
he said: "We must not discuss it here.  Let us return
to the inner chamber.  Some further refreshment you
need before going out into the storm.  Let us further
consider my offer privately.  These señoras&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" interrupted the Indian.  "I care nothing if
Administrator Mendoza hears me, let alone a storm-driven
señora or two.  The refreshment you offer is our
own cache.  Remember, the offer that carries weight
with us is, money down."
</p>

<p>
His fellow mumbled some word of assent.
</p>

<p>
The conversation was now plainly heard by the doña.
</p>

<p>
The dueña half awakened.  "Are we nearly home?"
sleepily.  "That Luis is a poor driver."
</p>

<p>
She slept again.
</p>

<p>
"Old lady likely is riled about all this noise when she
wants to sleep," Brown remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Come back, amigos.  Let us not decide thus a matter
of grave importance.  Come, talk further in
retirement, and then make another appointment, if
necessary."  This from the Captain.
</p>

<p>
The Indian stamped in fury.
</p>

<p>
"Come back, you say&mdash;always come back to the other
chamber.  You haggle as do market-women over eggs.
I know the vastness of the prize you seek.  As
superintendent of the Mission vessels have I sold wheat to
English dogs in the north and Mexican friends in the
south, so do I know of what I speak.  Its coast line
alone marks a thousand miles.  Itself is an empire ten
times the area of your petty island.  I say I am willing
to help you make your own this territory, still you
haggle, haggle.  Huh!"
</p>

<p>
"But, my friend, we must keep these matters&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, my friend&mdash;my friend!" the Indian mocked.
"Men unnumbered are at my command.  Still, you have
only words, words, words."
</p>

<p>
"At the proper time and place&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The proper time and place is now and here.  One
hundred thousand pesos' value in your English gold
notes&mdash;you claim you have the money in Monterey&mdash;place
you in my hand the day the next new moon is born.
Then, when you wish, my subjects in the inland&mdash;I am
their king&mdash;declare Great Britain's flag to be their
own, and I will hold them your loyal subjects."
</p>

<p>
Brown threw some wood on the embers.  "That Injun
is yelpin' back talk at the Cap'n any fool can see.  I
never could stand much sass from sech people myself,"
in an aside to Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"Come, friend, we may not deliberate here for others
to overhear.  Come with me.  I have your point of
view&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, or no, señor.  You have my point of view, you
say.  Then, accept or refuse.  You are not the only
bidder."
</p>

<p>
"A glass of aguardiente in the inner chamber&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you refuse!  In coming here my time was
wasted.  I go elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
Casting blanket away he strode toward the darkness
and the downpouring rain.  As he neared the fire the
light showed his face clearly.  It was curiously wrinkled,
not unlike a savage dog ready to bite.  His companion
followed him.
</p>

<p>
The leader was the dreaded Yoscolo, the craftiest
Indian in the Californias, and the best educated.  The
other was Stanislaus, once of the Mission of San José,
a man as cruel as Yoscolo, if less clever.
</p>

<p>
The doña cuddled nearer the bed as they passed,
</p>

<p>
"Hold!" cried the Captain as the Indians reached
the cave entrance.  "I'll accept your proposition."
</p>

<p>
They turned.
</p>

<p>
"Come back and we will arrange preliminaries
within."
</p>

<p>
"Done!" said the leader.  Stanislaus grunted affirmation.
</p>

<p>
A shout sounded in the open, followed by the words:
</p>

<p>
"Here is the carreta, Señor Mendoza, and footprints
leading on.  Have the men bring lights."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza's voice gave some order.
</p>

<p>
"Juan Antonio, you did well," he continued.
</p>

<p>
The Indians, Yoscolo and Stanislaus, vanished like
wraiths.
</p>

<p>
"More Injuns, Cap'?" inquired Brown.
</p>

<p>
"Possibly.  Let us go."
</p>

<p>
"And leave the ladies to be skeered to death?  No,
sirree!  I stay."
</p>

<p>
"Please stay," requested Carmelita in English.  "My
father is here and will thank you."
</p>

<p>
"The women are safe, Brown.  Out the other
entrance of the cave.  Come, I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you say, Cap'&mdash;not that I'm skeered of her
pop.  You lead and I'll foller."
</p>

<p>
Just as the darkness hid them Juan Antonio came
into the cave.  He was covered with mud.  Mendoza
followed on horseback.  Mounted peons filled the cave
entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Papacito!  Papacito!"  Carmelita ran toward her
father.
</p>

<p>
"My child, come thou to me!" springing to the
ground and clasping her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"I'll not have such a commotion in my house," announced
the dueña, returning from sleep.  "It is not
the hour for the fandango."
</p>

<p>
Light flared from the replenished fire.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Señor Mendoza!" now quite awake.  "How
did you manage to find this place on such a dark night?"
</p>

<p>
Mendoza pointed to Juan Antonio.  "He followed
your steps even in the darkness.  To horse, at once,
señora, and you too, my child.  The storm abates, only
to resume shortly.  We must reach the main road
before the rising water bars our way.  Let us go.  May
God be thanked for your safety!  How made you this
fire?"
</p>

<p>
"Those who are gone built it, my father."
</p>

<p>
"When we numbered not thy carreta with the others
sorrow darker than the night ruled my soul.  Now is the
blackness light.  Hence, and quickly!  To horse, all!"
</p>

<p>
In a moment the cave was alone with the fire and the
shadows.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
THE POLITICAL POT SIMMERS
</h3>

<p>
"Big game occupyin' mud houses endurin' the wet
spell, be they Cap'?"
</p>

<p>
The Captain sharply drew up his bridle reins.
</p>

<p>
"Brown, are the wages I pay satisfactory to you?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet, Cap'.  They're the best I've ever had.  If
the wages and the place didn't suit me, you'd have
heard me talk long before this."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my man.  We are now entering Monterey,
the capital of this province.  Your sole concern there
will be with preparations for further journeys according
as I give you orders."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you say, Cap'," from the placid Brown.
"Of course you remember I shipped with you on the
proposition of big game huntin'."
</p>

<p>
The other did not reply.
</p>

<p>
The small adobe dwellings, dubbed "mud houses" by
Brown, were succeeded by more pretentious ones as the
riders neared the town proper.  From every dooryard
the prickly-pear cactus pointed its heavy oval leaves.
Sweet peas rioted in tinting of sky and sunshine.  The
Castilian rose, blushing and demure, bowed from its
stem in challenge to the hand of the passer-by.
</p>

<p>
It was the children rolling and tumbling along the
muddy street who drew Brown out of his silence.
</p>

<p>
"By hicky! this here is a monstrous place for children.
Just now I actually counted eighteen on one
front stoop.  They was in reg'lar graydashun of sizes
from a foot up to five feet six inches, I should
jedge."  This critically.
</p>

<p>
"The province could easily support one thousand
times its present population," replied the other.
</p>

<p>
Amusement and contempt struggled together on the
face of honest Brown.
</p>

<p>
"One thousand times as many Injuns as is cumberin'
the ground right now!  By hickey!  I don't think the
Almighty should allow it."
</p>

<p>
They entered the large plaza around which were
many of the important buildings of the capital.  Here
ran in full stream the life of early California.  Indian
women, gay in colored shawl and gown, edged their way
among the fiery steeds drawing the carreta of the
grandee's family.  The Mexican smoking his corn-paper
cigarito touched elbows with the hidalgo's son who was
clad in velvet and fine linen, with inlaid gold on his
hat-band and gold spur on his heels.
</p>

<p>
Skins brown, skins red, skins white intermingled.
Wealth and lack of it walked side by side.  There was
no poverty in the California of this time.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I swanny!" from Brown.  "Did you ever see
such a theayter?"
</p>

<p>
The Captain alighted near a long line of low buildings.
A peon came forth bowing obsequiously.
</p>

<p>
"Let this man take the horses, Brown.  He will show
you an eatinghouse.  Remain not very far from this
place until I return."
</p>

<p>
"Well, by Gosh!  Left with the heathen and his flesh
pots!  I say, Cap'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Captain was gone.  Whereupon Brown followed
whither the peon led him, the while speaking naïve
criticisms of this worthy and of all things Californian.
The Indian understood nothing, but grinned obligingly
whenever he saw the stranger had completed some period
or other of his discourse.
</p>

<p>
The disappearance of his "Cap'" did not disturb
Brown.  He had become too well accustomed to the
flittings of the chief.  Their place of residence was in
a cañon of the high mountains, a score of miles east of
the pueblo San José.  Here a rude cabin had been found
formerly occupied by vaquero peons.  From this point
the leader and his factotum sallied forth on many an
excursion.  If Brown wondered at the meaning of it
all, he rarely questioned, and never searchingly.  It
sufficed that finally they would hunt "big game."
</p>

<p>
The Captain, hastening along a narrow street, came
to a plaza smaller than the one he had left, but
otherwise similar to it, around which were grouped many of
the homes of officialdom.  This plaza was the center of
the fashionable as well as of the political life of the
province.
</p>

<p>
He stopped before one of the most imposing
residences.  Within the porte-cochere a man sat on a
bench.  He was the outside guardian of the dwelling, a
position of importance at the time.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to speak with one of the house," the Captain
announced.
</p>

<p>
The other arose and bowed ceremoniously.
</p>

<p>
"Whom have I the honor of addressing?"
</p>

<p>
"Will you carry the Señora Doña Valentino word
that a man is here to see her on the king's business?"
</p>

<p>
The stranger's unpretentious attire and travel-stained
appearance had not deterred the guard from
showing him the suave courtesy a guest should receive,
but the words, "on the king's business" seemed to sting
the Spanish-American.
</p>

<p>
"Señor," in grandiose manner, "I am a citizen of
Mexico, an official of this household.  No king and no
one on the king's business is welcome where rules the
republic of Mexico."
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, man! take my words to the señora.
She will understand.  I have no time for your heroics.
Hurry up, I tell you!"
</p>

<p>
The other crossed his arms and looked disdainfully
at the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"On the king's business, you say!  On the king's
business!  Have you been asleep these many years and
awakened only now?  Have you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Have done with your twaddle, man.  I'll find somebody
inside who will carry my word."  He started along
the porte-cochere to the front door.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!  Stop!  At your peril!  Stay your feet, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Benito.  I'll usher the señor to the
reception room myself.  Come, amigo, with me," broke
in a soft voice now addressed to the Captain.
</p>

<p>
The petty official was all apologies and deep bows.
The Captain paid no attention to him.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Captain, with me."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, Señora Valentino."
</p>

<p>
"I chanced to be passing the main vestibule and saw
you.  Benito's patriotism was opposing your way.
No?"
</p>

<p>
They were walking along a wide corridor of the
mansion.  Sunlight poured in through many small-paned
windows.  Peons, men and women, were constantly
going and coming.
</p>

<p>
"This Benito's patriotism should be flogged out of
his skin," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
The lady laughed.  They reached a large door which
she opened by pressing a spring at the side.
</p>

<p>
"His patriotism, then, is but skin deep, you think?"
</p>

<p>
She motioned the Captain to a chair.  The door
slammed with a metallic click.  They were in a small
room well lighted.  Book shelves, closely filled, writing
material, and desks, bespoke the library.
</p>

<p>
"I fancy this creature's patriotism would well be
termed impertinence.  This have I seen often enough
disappear under fervent application of a riding-whip."
</p>

<p>
She looked closely at the speaker.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Farquharson," after a moment, "you have
been in the Californias more months than I have weeks.
Neither is this your first visit.  No?"
</p>

<p>
"It is not."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Greater opportunities for observation, decidedly,
have you had than I.  Still, I will say, noble señor, that
the Mexicans here are vastly different from the natives
of Hindustan where you have been; or even from the
peasantry of southeastern Europe where, in other times,
your fertile talents have found employment."
</p>

<p>
"True of the few Spaniards here, and their descendants.
I cannot agree, my lady, with you as to the Mexicans.
They&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She raised a delicate, well-jeweled hand, perhaps to
interrupt him; more likely, to emphasize what she had
begun to say.
</p>

<p>
"My Captain, blows will never win the Mexican to
favor your cause&mdash;I should say, our cause&mdash;any more
than will they the Spaniard.  Both have tasted here the
sweets of personal liberty in no small degree.  We must
imbue them with a desire for the ampler freedom of
Anglo-Saxon civilization, balancing thereby their love
for Latin forbears; or, at least, for Latin form."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson lightly struck the desk near his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Gain the leaders, señora, gain the leaders; and we
drive the others after them like sheep.  Once, in
Calcutta&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps in some province of India&mdash;never in the
province of California.  Bethink you, Captain!
Suppose that bold spirit in the north, Mendoza, should
dream your great country has here an agent purposing
to do what you say.  Not the years of the prophet,
which he has lived, would hold him from leading his
mounted peons, night and day in search of you."
</p>

<p>
"Then what, my lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Then delivering you, at the end of a lariat, to the
Colonel Barcelo, my brother-in-law, owner of this house,
and head of the military prison here."
</p>

<p>
The beautiful woman, leaning in her chair, placed
her hand on the Captain's arm.  "Now to business.
Your message found me here two days ago.  Of course
mine found you."  She paused a moment thoughtfully,
then continued:
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Barcelo returns to-night.  I have planned
for you to visit us this evening.  You are my friend,
Captain Farquharson, whom I knew in London two
years ago.  You are in the West for big game.  Is it
not so?"  She laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Does Colonel Barcelo know of the wishes of my
government?"
</p>

<p>
"He knows nothing.  I am seeking to prepare him
for such knowledge, however.  To-night you may speak
much or little, as you think wise."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, you spent several days at the home of
Señor Mendoza after the storm.  Did any word of yours
sound him as to his political feelings?"
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza's words on such matters come
slowly.  I believe his thoughts are correspondingly
rapid."
</p>

<p>
"Why so, señora?"
</p>

<p>
"During my short stay in his hacienda house many
young men came there.  You know his daughter
Carmelita is a beautiful girl."
</p>

<p>
The Captain started to speak, but smiled instead.
</p>

<p>
"These caballeros were duly presented to me.  For
some reason they spoke, at first casually, but, finally,
earnestly, concerning the future political status of this
province.  I listened."
</p>

<p>
The Captain laughed.  "Señora, how did you manage
to get the young hidalgos talking on such a subject?"
</p>

<p>
"Fie!  Fie!  Captain.  Even a soldier diplomat
should not seek to understand a woman's ways.  Let it
suffice that they talked."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, señora, they talked.  They said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Many things.  A number sat or were standing
around me in the reception room one evening.  The
wine warmed them, though they drank not
intemperately.  Politics rolled from their tongues.
</p>

<p>
"Spoke the handsome youth, Abelardo Peralta:
'Why wait for Mexico to drop us?  Let us declare
now our freedom and become a province of mighty
England.'  A dozen others joined in declaring for
England.  Señor Mendoza was listening to all this
conversation, meanwhile beaming on everybody.  Now
he spoke for the first time.  Said he: 'Since we are
giving away provinces, let us go to the ballroom.  The
señoritas are waiting.  It is the province of hearts
there, and giving and taking is always in order.'  Thus
deftly did our wary host stem the current.  Mendoza's
keenness is an element not to be lightly considered."
</p>

<p>
"Was there Morando?  No?" asked Captain Farquharson,
falling into the manner of speech of the Spaniard.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Morando was there.  Eyes, ears, hands, feet,
and heart has he for the Señorita Doña Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
The serene calm of the woman ruffled ever so little.
</p>

<p>
"Morando cannot have vented his Spanish citizenship
thus soon.  Doubtless easily he becomes one of us."
</p>

<p>
"I fancy it will be as says the Señorita Mendoza,
who, in turn, is deeply in love with her father.
Capture the gray eagle and the nest is yours."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so.  I suppose so.  Why came Morando
to California, do you know?  Anything against him in
Madrid, anything we could use to influence him here,
I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing."  After a pause: "At
Mission San José there are two men who could persuade
North California for us or against us.  Mind, I say
'persuade'; for, unless I mistake greatly, neither one
would consent to act as bell-wether after which go
willy-nilly the sheep flock."
</p>

<p>
He waited for her to go on.
</p>

<p>
"One of these two men is, of course, Señor Mendoza;
the other is Padre Osuna."
</p>

<p>
"A word about the señor, my lady.  I recognize the
man's worth and ability, and the weight he would add
to our cause; yet I do not think it wise to approach him
myself."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask your reason?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Mendoza and I met in the old days when I
was a young man."
</p>

<p>
"A young man, Captain?" archly.
</p>

<p>
"I have seen a half century of life.  My meeting with
Mendoza was thus wise.  At Talavera the allied forces
opposed the French.  In a preliminary skirmish our
colonel was wounded.  My regiment held a position in the
extreme forward center.  Colonel Mendoza was hastily
called from the left wing of the army, where the Spanish
troops were, and was placed over us.  The French
began the battle by heavy cannonading.  The captain of
my own company, also the first and the second
lieutenant, were blown to pieces before an hour.  I was
third lieutenant.  To save the men from annihilation,
as I believed, I withdrew a little distance.
</p>

<p>
"The Spanish colonel was furious.  He dashed up on
his horse, ordered the company in position, subjecting
me all the while to vitriolic criticism."
</p>

<p>
"What did you, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"I replied to him.  He struck me with the flat of his
sword."
</p>

<p>
"And what did you then?"
</p>

<p>
"I could do nothing.  We were in the face of the
enemy then, as for months.  Later, the allied forces
were separated.  A generation has lived and passed
since that blood-stained day of Talavera.  Mendoza,
doubtless, does not remember me.  Still, it would
not be wise to risk injury to our cause by bringing to
play any ill feeling he might possibly retain against
me."
</p>

<p>
"Our Captain is judicious."  Continuing: "Know
you the value of these Californias?"
</p>

<p>
"They are the pivotal center of Orient and Occident.
My government well knows the harbors here, their
possibilities&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The señora's raised hand stopped him.  Her fingers
ran along the wall searchingly.  At last she pressed
hard, then harder.
</p>

<p>
The wall separated at a line above her head, the lower
part of the wall slowly sinking through the floor.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to show you the treasure-chamber of a
dead-and-gone governor of the Californias, when the
province was a part of Spain."
</p>

<p>
A room half the size of the library was in view.  Stone
mortars were on the floor, and on the shelves.  Resting
on the brims of the vessels, and caught on the rough
sides of the exteriors, were many yellow particles which
dully shone in the newly-admitted light.
</p>

<p>
"Why, this is gold! gold!" touching his fingers on the
edge of a jar.  "These stones must once have held the
ransom of a king!" pointing to the interior of one
mortar after another.  Amidst spider-webs and the
accumulated dust of years lay thin streaks of
gold-dust tracing the way from rim to bottom.
</p>

<p>
He examined an ancient broom which lay among the
receptacles, gold showing among its moldy strands.
"Zounds! señora.  It is pure gold.  I've seen it in its
native state the world over."
</p>

<p>
He crossed the room.  As he walked tiny nuggets of
the metal which had escaped the sweepings of the
old-timer grated under his feet.  Fingermarks could be seen
on the floor where the treasure had been scooped up
by the single and double handfuls.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty years ago I was told that California's hills
and valleys framed a skeleton of virgin gold.  Here
may be proof of it.  Pray, my lady, what do you know
of this?  Where did the gold come from?"
</p>

<p>
She indicated some maps hanging on the walls.
"These drawings show whence came the gold which once
rested here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;they show&mdash;they show a river flowing
from high hills&mdash;and the direction from Monterey&mdash;north
of east it is.  Here is the scale of miles.  Why,
it is not a fortnight's journey to the place.  Ah!&mdash;here
are signs&mdash;yes, signs&mdash;but, perdition! they are
hieroglyphics.  I can make out nothing more.  Señora, how
in the name of mystery did you learn of this trick-room?"
</p>

<p>
She had been standing quietly, noting with interest
and some little amusement the varied activities and
remarks of the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"The secret was made known to me in Spain.  The
one-time Spanish governor built a palace in Seville, on
his home-coming from Monterey, and lived ever after
as a prince.  These jars supplied the wherewithal.  As
I heard it, he intended to return some day, on private
ship, for yet vaster measure of this golden sifting which
lies hidden in the California hills, but alas! too much
good living and gout did not permit."
</p>

<p>
"This is wonderful&mdash;most wonderful!  Somewhere in
the hills there is gold, quantities of gold.  Likewise,
there is gold in these fertile valleys, for they smile in
verdure and give promise of rich harvest a week after
the drought is over.  My lady, the world never dreams
of the possibilities of this province."
</p>

<p>
"Clive gave India to England.  May we not do even more?"
</p>

<p>
"Just so, señora, just so.  Does anyone else know of
this room?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite likely no one.  Even Colonel Barcelo does not,
his own house as it is."
</p>

<p>
"But these maps!  Do you not think it singular that
the owner did not most carefully preserve these
talismanic signs, and take them away with him?"
</p>

<p>
"They were left here with purpose, friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
"And that purpose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oceans are stormy, distances long, buccaneers
many, brave Captain."
</p>

<p>
"I do not catch your meaning, señora.  Do enlighten
me."
</p>

<p>
"In plain words, then: if that gold should, perchance,
take wings, the whilom possessor, aided by his maps,
could get another precious cargo.  But if the maps, as
well, should take unto themselves flight, what then?
Perhaps no more of the yellow metal!  So, my wise and
thrifty governor-general of the province made two sets
of drawings, taking the one with him, leaving the other
snugly ensconced in our little treasure-chamber here,"
pointing whimsically about the room.
</p>

<p>
"But, my lady, how did you learn all these things?"
</p>

<p>
"This same governor-general was my late husband's
grandfather.  He left in cipher a description of this
room, of the maps and of the mine.  For more than
fifty years the key to the cipher was mislaid.  I chanced
to come across it, six months ago, in the archives of my
husband's family.  The cryptogram stated that the
treasure which once filled these mortars was but a hint
of greater riches in the mountains."
</p>

<p>
"What a country!  What a land this will be when
the union jack tips the flag-pole at Monterey!"
</p>

<p>
"A country well worth the hire, Captain mine."
</p>

<p>
"You speak of Friar Lusciano Osuna.  I called on
him, not long since, with letters.  He was ill, but very
courteous.  I explained a little of our work here.  I take
it he is a Mexican citizen."
</p>

<p>
"He is a citizen of Great Britain."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps by some sufferance."
</p>

<p>
"By his eminent right!  That government would go
much farther in his protection than it would for you
or for me, though we are its special agents in a great
cause."
</p>

<p>
"Just the man we need, then, señora."
</p>

<p>
A knock at the door.
</p>

<p>
Noiselessly weight and spring raised the movable
wall to its place.
</p>

<p>
Without was an elderly Mexican leaning rather
stiffly on a cane.
</p>

<p>
"Your gringo servant has made much trouble for
himself, and is now in jail," the man said to
Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know it is my servant?"
</p>

<p>
"He told me.  I am under jailer.  I was directed to
Colonel Barcelo's, whither some said you had gone.  The
peons here brought me to you.  Your servant, sir,
getting in liquor, shot one of the officers of the guard.
Now, he wishes to see you on a matter of gravest
importance.  Doubtless he will be executed at sunset.
Will you come, señor?"
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!  Adios, señora.  I'll return as soon as I have
settled this wretched business.  I must get poor Brown
out of his predicament, let come what may."
</p>

<p>
The messenger, followed by the Captain, passed out
of the house.  They followed the street to a narrow
passage and turned into it.  The supposed elderly
Mexican shook himself.  Away fell disguise, and the
scowling face of Yoscolo was before Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"You root-digging beast!" exclaimed the Englishman
through his shut teeth.  He aimed a blow with his
fist at the chieftain's head.  Yoscolo ducked to one side.
A blanket fell from behind over the Captain's face and
shoulders.  A strong embrace pinioned his arms and
carried him up many stairs, his muffled shouts not
sounding above the shuffle of accompanying feet.
</p>

<p>
Soon Farquharson was pushed through an entrance.
Yoscolo gave quick orders in the Indian tongue.  His
men bound the Englishman hand and foot, and removed
the blanket from his head.  He found himself in a large
room lighted by a lantern.  Several rude benches lined
the walls, while dried grass in a corner where blankets
lay marked the sleeping place of Indians or of
lower-class Mexicans.
</p>

<p>
"Bring a settee for the Captain," said the leader,
with mock politeness.  "He must be weary after his
recent exertion."
</p>

<p>
His men complied.
</p>

<p>
"More comfortable now, amigo?" when Farquharson
was seated.  "Well, then, let's to business.  I've not much
time to spend with you."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson paid no attention to him.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you do not understand.  Is it so?  Well,
listen now.  Captain Farquharson, you promised me
the value of a hundred thousand pesos in English gold
notes the day the next new moon was born.  That day
was yesterday.  The gold notes are in your hands, not
mine.  Your word is a lie."  The Indian was speaking
in very fair English.
</p>

<p>
The Captain did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"You waste my time," speaking now in Spanish.  "I
have much to do and cannot trifle.  You have in
Monterey, in the hands of the English consul, the value of
one hundred thousand pesos in gold notes.  So you have
said.  Place the money in my hand and I'll turn my
loyal subjects in the interior valleys to your cause.  My
word is true."
</p>

<p>
"Take away these cords.  Allow me to go free; then,
come with me to the consul's, and there we'll consider
what you say."
</p>

<p>
The Indian shook his head.  "Captain Farquharson
never leaves this room alive unless the money is paid
first."
</p>

<p>
"The British consul will not pay you the money
unless I am with you."
</p>

<p>
"Fear not, Captain.  I'll take chances on getting the
money."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson laughed in spite of his bonds.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Indian!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense or not, give me an order, leaving blank the
name of payee; stamp it with your seal&mdash;I found it in
your pocket just now&mdash;and I'll collect the money.  In
two hours from that time you will be free."
</p>

<p>
"I must take time to decide what I'll do."
</p>

<p>
"There is only one thing for you to do."
</p>

<p>
"Let me free, so that I may decide the more quickly."
</p>

<p>
A voice called through the door.  Without replying
to Farquharson, Yoscolo made a quick gesture.  The
others gagged the prisoner with a scarf-end, and
blindfolded him with a piece of silken sash.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened.  A whispered conversation
followed, then he heard the heavy tread of Yoscolo
descending the stairs.
</p>

<p>
The men placed the Captain on the bed.
</p>

<p>
After what appeared an interminable time the watchers
ungagged him and placed food at his lips.  He ate
of the tortillas, or Mexican corn bread, and of the chili
con carne, or stewed meat and chili peppers, which were
offered.  A glass of Mission wine followed.
</p>

<p>
"Amigos, I can make you rich.  Loosen these ropes
and come with me.  Why not be free from such a master
as Yoscolo, and be rich at the same time?  A ship will
take you and your money where he can never reach you."
</p>

<p>
The gag was hastily replaced.
</p>

<p>
The hours passed slowly.  At last he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
The leader's voice awakened him, saying: "Free his
mouth and eyes."
</p>

<p>
It was done.
</p>

<p>
In the dim light he saw Yoscolo standing before him
with folded arms.  The others, like unblinking
watchdogs, were by his side.
</p>

<p>
"Captain, will you write that order?  Surely, you
have had time to think now."
</p>

<p>
"It would be foolish to do as you say.  Come now,
release me; give some earnest of turning your San
Joaquin camps to our side, then I'll pay you the money
and bear no grudge against you for tying me up here."
</p>

<p>
The chieftain grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Grudge or not, white man, I'm too useful to your
side for you to work out spite against me.  Write that
order.  Write, also, a note to the consul saying you
were suddenly called to Los Angeles&mdash;or any place.
Date both order and note two days ago&mdash;you have been
here in this room that length of time&mdash;and you go free.
I have, then, the money; you will have my support&mdash;a
very happy ending to your detention."
</p>

<p>
"But see, Yoscolo&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Yoscolo interrupted with an oath.  "You shall haggle
with me no more.  Men, bring fire for his feet and hands.
I'll make the fox come to time.  Captain Farquharson,
you write that order and note, or I'll torture you till
you do."
</p>

<p>
A fourth Indian entered the room silently, and spoke
to the leader.
</p>

<p>
Yoscolo stamped in fury.  "Carrajo!  Puerco!  I not
only have to be the brains, but the hands, in everything.
What's the matter with Stanislaus?  Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know," meekly replied the messenger.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know!  What do you know?  Get out of here!"
</p>

<p>
The man disappeared, closely followed by Yoscolo.
</p>

<p>
The Indian watchers looked at Farquharson without
speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Amigos&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
They placed their hands on their pistols threateningly.
</p>

<p>
"Ease the cords on my feet," he asked.  "Your chief
will not object to that."
</p>

<p>
Each Indian touched his lips, then dropped his hands
to his pistol butt.
</p>

<p>
The sperm oil in the lantern burned low.  The men
extinguished the light, to replenish the oil.  In a few
minutes it was again burning brightly.
</p>

<p>
The astounded Indians saw Farquharson standing in
front of them, wrists and ankles free, brandishing an
open clasp-knife.
</p>

<p>
They cowered away from him.  He moved toward the
door as fast as his benumbed limbs could take him.
</p>

<p>
Dread of Yoscolo overcame their superstitious fear.
They drew their pistols, and commanded: "Hands up!
Away from the door!"
</p>

<p>
Farquharson dropped his knife.  He moved his arms
over his head in extraordinary fashion, grimaced at the
ceiling, then moved slowly toward his jailers.  Flirting
his fingers ominously at them, he exclaimed in sepulchral
tones: "Winky, wanky, wunky, fum!  Winky,
wanky, wunky, fum!"
</p>

<p>
Despite the pain in his ankles he executed a miniature
war-dance on the floor, again solemnly uttering:
"Winky, wanky, wunky, fum!"
</p>

<p>
The Indians moved back from him, again overcome
by his "big medicine."  In one of his eccentric
movements he managed to knock over the lantern, the oil
running out over the floor.  They snorted in terror, and
began some incantation.
</p>

<p>
Farquharson found the door and started downstairs.
His feet refused further action.  He fell and slid down
to a landing.
</p>

<p>
The Indians heard the fall.  There was a colloquy
and a rush across the floor.
</p>

<p>
The Captain attempted to crawl to the next flight of
stairs, but he could move but slowly.
</p>

<p>
The Indians opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Light the lantern," called one.
</p>

<p>
A voice could be heard in the street: "Have ye seen
the Cap'n?  O, I say, have ye seen the Cap'n?  Durn
ye, can't ye understand American?"  Then, in a louder
tone: "I say, have any of you dum fools seen the
Cap'n?  Don't ye know anything in this 'ere country?"
Finally, still louder: "<i>Have any of you durned niggers
seen the Cap'n?</i>"
</p>

<p>
It was Brown searching for his employer, and trying
by strength of his lungs to make up for lack of
knowledge in his hearers.
</p>

<p>
"Brown!  Brown!" yelled Farquharson.  "Come here
quick!"
</p>

<p>
"Where be ye, Cap'?" from the delighted Brown.
</p>

<p>
"Here!  Up the stairs!  Quick!"
</p>

<p>
Finding the stairs was not a difficult matter, and up
came Brown, three steps at a time, shouting again:
"Where be ye, Cap'?"
</p>

<p>
The light through a begrimed window showed the
helpless Englishman on the landing.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I swanny!" wondered Brown.
</p>

<p>
"Get me to the street.  Be quick!  The Indians will
come."
</p>

<p>
Fear of Yoscolo gave spirit to the aborigines.  They
rushed down the stairs, one of them holding the lantern
which they had taken time to refill and light.  "Hands
up!" they commanded in Spanish, presenting their
weapons.  "Hands up! or we'll shoot."
</p>

<p>
Brown seized one of the men by waist and neck and
hurled him at the other.  "O, talk United States!" he
shouted.
</p>

<p>
The Indians fell headlong.  Brown lifted the Captain
to his shoulder and flew down the stairs.  Several pistol
shots missed aim, but no pursuit was attempted.
Brown's performance probably looked like more "big
medicine" to the Indians.
</p>

<p>
Soon the rescuer and his burden were outside.
</p>

<p>
"I've carried many a pig, Cap', but never down so
many stairs to wunst.  Where be ye hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm better now.  I think I can walk if you help me."
</p>

<p>
Brown assisted him along the way.
</p>

<p>
"Where were ye, Cap'?  As near as I can jedge
they're searchin' the whole country for ye."
</p>

<p>
"The men you saw were holding me captive."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I swanny!" from the disgusted serving-man.
"Held by a pack o' niggers!  I never could stand much
of that sort o' thing myself from sech critters."
</p>

<p>
Directly they were away from danger, with the life
of Monterey flowing smoothly around them.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
SEÑORA VALENTINO SEEKS TO INTEREST PADRE OSUNA
</h3>

<p>
The courtyard of Señor Mendoza's hacienda house
was glorious in light.  Patterns of Oriental
network were reflected from lanterns clustered along the
eaves, strung on improvised archways, or undulating
from the lofty flagpole.  Genial spring rejoiced everywhere,
no less in rare exotic floating in miniature lakes
than in the countless blooming flower species that were
at home in this Eden-land.  The soft air breathed
content as it moved in low voice around giant palm and
high-branching walnut.  As the evening waxed the
zephyr became a whisper, then sank to sleep on the fairy
scene with a sigh as faint as the rustle of a leaf.
</p>

<p>
The courtyard gate lay open wide.  Many of the
fairest and of the bravest in California were to pass
within after the day had ceased, to fare forth against
the rebirth of another sun.  Mendoza's welcome to the
late-coming rains took the form of pleasure-making for
the gentry of the countryside.  Neither thought, nor
labor, nor expense had been spared that this might be
a festal night long remembered in Alta California.
</p>

<p>
The lord of the manor sat in his private library.
</p>

<p>
"A visitor, Señor Mendoza," announced a peon.
</p>

<p>
"It is who?"
</p>

<p>
"The Padre Lusciano Osuna."
</p>

<p>
"Show him here.  No&mdash;wait.  I'll attend him from
the front myself."
</p>

<p>
A moment later the señor was at the padre's side.
"Welcome, reverend sir.  This house is happy that your
feet press its threshold."  Mendoza bowed in Castilian
grace, then extended his hand to the priest, who
accepted it in courteous grasp.
</p>

<p>
"And you are well, Padre?"
</p>

<p>
"Good health blesses me, Señor Mendoza.  How makes
it with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well.  Very well, indeed.  Come with me, Señor
Padre."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Padre Osuna," as they sat together shortly after,
"it pleases me that opportunity comes to thank you
for sending your major-domo, Juan Antonio, that
night the storm broke, to trace my daughter and her
dueña.  I have sought you each day since, only to find
you were still in Santa Cruz.  A father's heart thanks
you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"A pastor's solicitude for one of his flock deserves
not thanks, Señor Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"May I ask, reverend sir, why you brought so strong
a fighting force to meet us that night?  Juan Antonio
told me it was your order, but held his counsel further."
</p>

<p>
"He knew nothing more.  Early that afternoon there
came a peon, fugitive from the renegade camp.  After
much hesitation, so greatly are Yoscolo and Stanislaus
feared by the Indians, he told me he had seen the two
leaders traveling, no men with them, in the direction of
your merienda ground.  I cautioned him to silence lest
panic sweep over the Mission.  Marshaling bowmen and
carbineers, I mounted horse to come to your aid, should
the miscreants gather force and give any trouble.  Thus
I rode to you in the thunderstorm, having dispatched
couriers posthaste to the pueblo for further aid from
the soldiery there."
</p>

<p>
"The pueblo soldiers were already scouring the Los
Gatos hills near Santa Cruz for the ubiquitous Indian
leaders," said Señor Mendoza, "word having come in
from that region that an attack was imminent.  A
messenger from the pueblo met us in the foothills not long
before you came.  With him rode away Captain Morando,
to join his men and their lieutenant, my fighting
peons accompanying him.  We rested our horses.  A
rapid count of carretas by lantern light discovered the
absence of my daughter and the señora dueña.  At that
moment you came, reverend padre."
</p>

<p>
The priest bowed.  "I greatly regret that a sudden
recurrence of illness prevented me from going farther
with you that night.  I tarried home till Juan Antonio
came through the driving rain with news of the lost
ones' safety.  Strength soon returning, I went on my
way to Santa Clara and farther."
</p>

<p>
"You set out at midnight, in the howling storm?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Señor Mendoza.  Duty called me."
</p>

<p>
"That is the reply of a soldier, Padre Osuna."
</p>

<p>
"I am a soldier of the cross, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Well said!  Well said! good sir."
</p>

<p>
"Allow me to explain, señor, why I have thus come to
you when you are about to open your festivities.  Less
than an hour ago I returned from my journey.  A
messenger from Monterey was at the Mission bearing
written words from the representative of England there.
The message stated that an English citizen disappeared
two days ago in the capital city.  He left the home of
Colonel Barcelo that afternoon and no one has seen him
since.  Much anxiety is felt over his absence."
</p>

<p>
A peon appeared in the doorway.  "Colonel Barcelo
and lady, with Señora Valentino, await you, Señor
Mendoza.  The Colonel asks a moment's private interview."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me for a short time, reverend padre?"
</p>

<p>
Before Mendoza could depart the Colonel came bustling in.
</p>

<p>
"Heard your voice, my friend, and couldn't stand on
ceremony.  Have you received the news?  Most
interesting it is.  Well, the governor has resigned and
I am made acting-governor of the province pending the
new appointment.  The former governor is still in
Mexico City.  Fussy old curmudgeon he is.  Should
have resigned years ago.  What I want to know, Señor
Mendoza, is, are you laying plans to capture the office?
If you are not, I am sure of getting it, as sure of it as
if it was in my pocket here," tapping his breast-pocket
vigorously.  "What say you, Mendoza?" slapping the
señor's shoulder with heavy palm.
</p>

<p>
"I have pledged myself to remain administrator
while the need lasts," replied Mendoza, glancing at the
friar.  "The need yet exists, and I cannot hold two
offices."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!  Splendid!" exulted Barcelo.  "I'll take my
chances against the other aspirants, and you may be
assured there will be enough of them."
</p>

<p>
The Padre Lusciano Osuna had arisen.  The exuberant
Colonel now noticed him for the first time.
</p>

<p>
"Reverend sir, my obeisance!  Kindly do not repeat
what I have said of my political hopes."
</p>

<p>
Osuna bowed and smiled.  "As you wish, sir."
</p>

<p>
At that moment Señora Barcelo and his sister entered.
</p>

<p>
"My husband is irrepressible.  He actually bubbles
over like a mineral spring.  He requests a private
interview, then shouts his secrets from the housetops.
Reverend padre, I'm delighted to see you well again.
Delighted!  How pleasant to meet you on such an
occasion as this!  Reverend Padre Osuna, my sister,
Señora Valentino, very lately from Spain.  She was with
us the night you led those men to us in the rain.  No
time for introductions then, of course.  Ugh! what an
experience!"
</p>

<p>
The friar and Señora Valentino acknowledged the
introduction.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, Señor Padre," exclaimed Barcelo, "what
rag-and-bobtail followed you that night!  But it's the
way with Indians.  They run as children after anything
that promises excitement.  How like wet-dogs-on-horseback
they looked.  Poor Mendoza here quite lost his
head when his daughter's carreta turned up missing.
Lucky I was there.  Why, just send your Indians
back-trail in such a case and they can find anything."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel looked around in a self-satisfied way.
</p>

<p>
"Why, husband," said Señora Barcelo, "how you
so talk!  As I say, you are so irrepressible!  It always
seems you are nowhere but just in the front of everything."
</p>

<p>
"Quite the place for a soldier, señora, quite the
place."
</p>

<p>
Here Mendoza interposed.  "Señoras and señors,
will you not be seated?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," replied Barcelo.  "Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Barcelo, may I ask you if anything has been
heard of the Englishman who two days ago disappeared
in Monterey City?" said Señor Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the stentorian Colonel.
"Why, ha! ha! ha!  I should say something has been
heard of the fellow.  He walked into my house half an
hour before I left with some cock-and-bull story of
having been kidnaped.  Kidnaped!  Ha! ha! ha!  Good!"
</p>

<p>
The Colonel arose and stood before the others.  "Let
me give you my theory of the affair," self-complacency
shining on his rotund face.
</p>

<p>
"Husband, some other time.  The guests are surely
arriving and Señor Mendoza wishes to be occupied with
them."
</p>

<p>
"Patience, good wife, patience.  My dear, if you have
a fault in the world it is that you talk too much.
Now&mdash;let me see where was I when interrupted.  O,
yes!  The Englishman's disappearance.  The
explanation is a simple one."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel looked meaningly at his auditors.  "Just
too much aguardiente&mdash;native brandy.  It's most
deceptive stuff for a new beginner.  I once had the same
experience in Paris with absinthe."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Crisostimo, you never told me!  How dare
you speak of such a thing?" Señora Barcelo bridling.
</p>

<p>
"It was nothing, Clarinda, nothing, my love.  Merely
something that might happen to anyone&mdash;anyone of
investigating mind, I mean, of course.  Well, this
Englishman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O, Crisostimo, when were you in Paris and drank
so much absinthe?  It's simply disgraceful how we poor
women are deceived.  I'm going home to my uncle in
Spain."
</p>

<p>
"It was years ago, my love, years ago, long before I
met you.  I was a lieutenant then in the Spanish army.
Well, we were speaking of the affair in Monterey.  I
say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The less you say the better," from his wife, tartly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, how can you fill the position of governor's
wife if you possess such small pride!"
</p>

<p>
The words had magic effect.  The señora mopped her
eyes with a dainty lace kerchief, and in a moment was
all smiles.  Her husband almost swaggered with
suppressed importance.
</p>

<p>
"This Englishman was simply drunk.  Let me tell you
the whole case," this time without interruption.  "The
man called on my sister-in-law, Señora Valentino, a very
young woman, as you see."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino lowered her eyes in appropriate
recognition for the remark.
</p>

<p>
"I mean she is inexperienced in the world's ways, has
always been protected, led a sheltered life, and all that.
Well, this man she met occasionally in London some
time ago called on her at my house in Monterey.  The
fellow was simply drunk, and this poor lady, in her
simplicity, could see nothing of it.  Why, the house
guardian met him at my front door, and he began talking
nonsense about kings and so on.  Think of this! to
a stranger too!
</p>

<p>
"Well, the fellow gained entrance through my sister-in-law.
Seems to have behaved while within.  Soon came
a crony, some old pot-fellow, on a mock errand, and
away went the two to carouse again.  Then, the
Englishman was lost.  A hue and cry was raised.  The
inefficient town police do nothing.  Then I make it a
military matter, and, behold! the lost one comes walking
to my house with a ready story to tell.  Thus, the
kidnaping.  Ha! ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
Barcelo subsided into a chair and looked around for
approving words.
</p>

<p>
"How penetrating you men of affairs are!"  This
from Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"As the Englishman has made his appearance my
anxiety concerning him is over," remarked the padre.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly!  Certainly!" observed Barcelo.  "No
cause for alarm.  The man was taken by drink and
cooked up a story to suit the case."
</p>

<p>
"How clever the Colonel, my brother-in-law, is!"
again from Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"With his work as comandante and the added duties
of acting-governor, I cannot see how he will have time
to turn," said his wife, admiringly.
</p>

<p>
The friar laughed gently, Mendoza, more loudly.
</p>

<p>
"From the viewpoint of a simple mission-administrator
I can appreciate what such double work must mean.
I trust the Englishman will be more wary in the future
against kidnapers, that you may not be further
burdened from that quarter at least."
</p>

<p>
Barcelo winked knowingly.  "Brandy overnight
usually leaves headache in the morning.  The man must
be a seasoned drunkard, for when I saw him there was
no sign of his debauch.  Of course he has now learned
the strength of our native product, and I hope will
govern himself accordingly."
</p>

<p>
The serving peons with respectful insistence were
knocking at the door.  The guests were coming in
numbers.
</p>

<p>
The Señora Mendoza came into the room, curtsied
to the company, then said to her father, "Papacito,
many seek thee."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, my child."
</p>

<p>
"The child is right," said Barcelo.  "Señor Mendoza,
your place is with your arriving company.  Come,
señoras, let us forth to the grounds.  It is known that
I am here.  Many will be looking for me."  Then in a
confidential aside to Mendoza: "Will you write a letter
to the secretary of state in Mexico City setting forth
my qualifications for the governorship?  State what
you know for and against," with an air of great frankness.
</p>

<p>
"I'll do as you ask, Colonel."  Turning to the friar:
"Now, Señor Padre, we will resume.  The guests will
be well attended without my ministrations for the present."
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna placed a small package in his hand.
"This is the Jesuit bark you brought me in my recent
illness.  I could not accept it from you as Administrator
Mendoza, highly as I esteem the qualities of character
which led you to bring it to me.  From Señor Mendoza
I should have greatly valued the favor."
</p>

<p>
The other bowed understandingly.  "Still I cannot
separate Señor Mendoza from Administrator Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"Let it then be so.  Adios, Señor Mendoza," and the
friar stepped into the corridor.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere was the hum of voices and echoes of
laughter.  Bursts of music sounded from various parts
of the house or grounds where musicians had been
stationed.
</p>

<p>
Many salutations from the California gentry met the
priest as he passed along.  Just outside the outer gate
a hand was laid softly on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"May I have a few words with Padre Osuna?"
</p>

<p>
It was the Señora Valentino.  The light made splendid
play on her gown and jewels.  The woman was young
and fair, as well as exquisitely clad, but all this seemed
to be put away as she stood beside the dull-robed friar.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Señora Valentino.  If you thus request,
my time is at your disposal."
</p>

<p>
"Here is a bench near the gatekeeper's lodge.  Will
you sit here awhile, reverend father?"
</p>

<p>
The padre seated himself by the woman's side.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I should yet further introduce myself to
you.  My husband, the late Colonel Clodio Valentino,
was cousin-german to your mother, daughter of
Ambassador Altamira, of Castile."
</p>

<p>
The friar looked keenly at his companion.  "I have
not seen my mother in ten years.  She spoke often of
Clodio Valentino, colonel of the Royal Hussars, and
of his wife.  It would seem as if the lady must be much
older than you, señora."
</p>

<p>
"I am the Colonel's second wife.  We were married
seven years ago."
</p>

<p>
"I see."
</p>

<p>
"Padre Osuna, you can be of wonderful service to the
great kingdom of which you are a citizen.  In so doing
you fulfill a duty to your state and to this province of
California."
</p>

<p>
"Kindly explain, señora."
</p>

<p>
"California is as a ripe apple ready to drop into a
basket.  It oscillates to and fro.  Great Britain holds
one basket; the United States of America, another.
Russia, with a third basket, stands at a distance.
Mexico is the tree which must lose the apple in any case.
Reverend padre, you have the length and strength of
arm so to shake the tree that the Great Britain basket
catches the apple."
</p>

<p>
"Why should I do so, if I could?"
</p>

<p>
"The United States looks eagerly on this province.
That colossal nation reaches now to the Gulf of Mexico
on the south, and it seeks to make the Pacific Ocean
its boundary on the west.  A continent-wide dominion
is its aim."
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, I live secluded from the world,
and do not wish to share in its politics."
</p>

<p>
"But politics can affect the welfare of your spiritual
children.  Call to mind the secularization of your
missions by the Mexican government.  That was a
political act, yet it cut the nerve of your Order's religious
enterprise in this part of the world.  Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe that it is.  Yet our Order once built here
a Christian community from wandering savages, and
our heart has not lost zeal, nor our hand willingness."
</p>

<p>
"I rejoice with you in all that, reverend father, but
it was done when the flag of considerate Spain waved
here, and the work of the church was deemed
paramount.  That flag has departed forever.  Why not,
then, seek another protector for Missions and for
province which will make void the inconsiderate work of
Mexico, and which will not be second to Spain, in good
endeavor?"
</p>

<p>
"Señora, when rumors of change float in the air I
close the windows and doors of my soul to all, that I
may give myself unstinted to the work among God's
untutored children."
</p>

<p>
"Why not safeguard the temporal and spiritual
rights of your Indians?  Ah! padre, think of India over
which England is suzerain.  There the amplest freedom
is not only allowed but guaranteed to each native cult;
neither does anyone hear of sequestration of church
property."
</p>

<p>
"It is the truth.  English rule and justice walk with
equal pace in India."
</p>

<p>
"England would not do less in California for our
church."  In her enthusiasm she leaned toward him,
her brown eyes flashing.  "Else comes the United
States.  Her armed ships patrol our coast, sounding,
always sounding, for deep and shallow water, though
the coastline of this province was charted long before
the United States of America was born.  Why hazard
the contingencies of American government, when the
weight of her little finger, did she so wish, could be
heavier than was the whole hand of Mexico?  I, as a
child of the church, ask you this.  From my present
home in an official family in Monterey I can read the
signs of the time.  Padre Osuna, we must act, and
quickly."
</p>

<p>
"Another has spoken to me somewhat of this."
</p>

<p>
"That other was Captain Farquharson?  No?"
</p>

<p>
The padre did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"The Captain seeks to bring California from
unsatisfactory Mexico to stable and safe England.  Señor
Padre, for the good of souls, the souls of the Indians
you love, help him!"
</p>

<p>
The Franciscan sprang to his feet, his figure erect
and his face radiant.
</p>

<p>
"But, Misericordia! what can I do!" sinking back
into his seat.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, humble friar!  You have the power of a Savonarola
who threw the wicked, bloody city of Florence
to her praying knees.  Have I not heard you in the
cathedral in Seville, and again in Barcelona?  Did not
the soldiers draw strong cordons at the great cathedral
in Madrid when you spoke there, lest the surging crowd
crush themselves at the entrance?  Ah, mighty one! speak
to the people of this province, tell them of
England and of her benevolent sway.  Lift your voice for
your country's good.  Instruct and persuade, as you
alone can, priest of the golden tongue!  Then, listen,
and from your hearers will come cheers for the mistress
of the seas and her kindly rule.  If you are silent, your
church and your state lose much because a man marvelously
gifted failed in manifest duty."
</p>

<p>
"I hold the call of duty supreme."
</p>

<p>
"You used that as a text for one of your sermons in
Seville."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you connect me with that preacher in the
cathedrals?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you are the same man, though you now
wear a beard and write but a portion of your former
name."
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, that I am here under my present
name is approved by my conscience and by my superiors."
</p>

<p>
"I doubt not, good padre."
</p>

<p>
The priest looked fixedly at the flag gently waving
high above their heads.
</p>

<p>
"Padre, the good of souls!  The welfare of your
Order!  Your Indian wards!"
</p>

<p>
"I know&mdash;I know."
</p>

<p>
They arose.
</p>

<p>
He saluted and turned to go.  Then he hesitated.
"My will is that of my superior."
</p>

<p>
He walked away a few steps, paused, and stood facing
her, with:
</p>

<p>
"'Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not.'  My children of the wilderness cry unto
me&mdash;unto me."
</p>

<p>
Making the sign of the cross, he continued slowly
down the road.
</p>

<p>
The joy of triumph shone in the señora's smile.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br />
THE BEGINNING OF THE BALL AT SEÑOR
<br />
MENDOZA'S HACIENDA HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
If taste and industry had been used in decorating the
exterior of Señor Mendoza's mansion for the great
ballroom function, the interior gave evidence of no lack
of these same qualities.
</p>

<p>
The artistic spirit of the Latin is to the manner born,
and the early Californian developed his inheritance by
daily communings with the beauties of earth, and air,
and sky.  Mendoza, moreover, had seen the wonder
spots from Paris to Madrid and Vienna; and the fruits
of his experience had ripened and mellowed in the years
of wealth and leisure he had spent on his estate at
Mission San José.
</p>

<p>
For smaller parties he had reception room, dining
room and dancing hall finished in the oak that his own
forests furnished, peons having skillfully hewed the
wood, then, under the master's directions, polishing the
grain until the markings stood out prominently.
</p>

<p>
It was the ballroom used for the baile&mdash;large party&mdash;that
showed the resource of California and the cleverness
of Mendoza at the best.  This room, reaching the
length of one side of the house, was built in redwood,
of which California is sole producer.
</p>

<p>
Mammoth trees, grown on the mountains near Santa
Cruz, had been felled and split from end to end.  The
exposed sections were trimmed and smoothed, showing,
in many a curious layer of etching, the centuries these
monarchs had lived.  Oxen by the score and Indians by
the hundreds had been engaged for months in bringing
to Mission San José these timbers which, placed side by
side, made the walls and ceiling of the apartment.
</p>

<p>
"Of the many wood grains," Mendoza often said, "I
prefer the redwood for broad effects.  The convolutions
run in ampler curve and build themselves readily into
large dimensions."
</p>

<p>
The room was looking its best to-night.  Chandeliers,
fed by sperm-oil, gave subdued light through delicately
tinted shades.  Candles branched from the walls, playing
their softened brightness everywhere.  The reddish
wood glistened and showed in strong relief the story of
its years.
</p>

<p>
In the corners were grouped potted plants and flowers
and shrubs.  Radiant bougainvilleas and flaunting
hibiscus were side by side with delicate maidenhair ferns
modestly featuring the mossy rocks on which they first
saw life.
</p>

<p>
Rare orchids from Japan, grown robust in the kindlier
air of California, strove to surpass in beauty their
indigenous relatives.  Poinsettias, vivid in their tintings,
stood unabashed with the modest lily of the valley and
the shrinking violet.  The California poppy, lover of
both hill and lowland, drooped its head and half folded
its petals, diffident in the presence of the grandees of
the floral kingdom.
</p>

<p>
The guests had not yet come into the ballroom.  The
reception rooms, dressing rooms, and the wide grounds
still held them.  The señoritas, with hair flowing over
their shoulders, and clad in silken skirt and train, with
bodice, also silken, close-fitting and high-necked, were
not yet ready for the dance.  The señoras, near their
charges, were chatting away the time.
</p>

<p>
The men strolled about smoking their cigaritos, passing
a word here, a jest there, until the music should call
them.  Their dress was that of the Spanish cavalier of
the time.  From their shoulders fell the poncho&mdash;long
cape&mdash;made of beaver from Peru.  Later in the evening
this garment would be removed, showing old and young
in velvet knee-pants, deer-skin leggins beautifully
stamped and broidered, and with shoes of polished
leather held by golden clasps.
</p>

<p>
The coat, likewise of imported beaver, reached only
to the girth, and was ornamented on arms and shoulders
with silver and gold thread.
</p>

<p>
Around their waists were draped bright-colored silken
sashes, the ends long and sweeping.  A white linen shirt,
elaborately fluted and sparkling with diamonds,
completed their evening dress.  Men and women were lavish
in their display of jewels.
</p>

<p>
Glorious, splendid California was worthily represented
by her sons and daughters the night of Señor
Mendoza's fiesta.
</p>

<p>
In the garden a young man in the uniform of an army
officer was speaking with a girl.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña Carmelita, a dance with you on the
ballroom floor; another sit I with you in the open.  Is
it not so?"
</p>

<p>
"Señor, the Captain Morando, I promised you a
mazurka, nothing more."
</p>

<p>
"Truly, señorita, but when sitting one finds words to
speak the thoughts that rise in the heart while flying
feet are pursuing the spirit of the dance."
</p>

<p>
"As hostess I may not deny the petition of a guest."
</p>

<p>
"O, Señorita Doña!  I speak not as a guest to a hostess.
I am at your feet ever, as a subject to a queen.
May I not pay a vassal's homage to you?  With many
caballeros you tread the dance, never granting further
favor.  May I not be the exception?"
</p>

<p>
The señorita and the Captain were standing under a
big palm.  Seeing her cross the courtyard he had
hastened to intercept her.
</p>

<p>
She drew away.
</p>

<p>
"Since the Señor Captain frees me from my obligation
as hostess I will tell him he is well stocked in
presumption."
</p>

<p>
In a moment the shadows lost the girl.
</p>

<p>
The young man was disconsolate.  He buckled his
sword-belt tightly, then loosened it.  Pulling his laced
cap lower on his forehead he moved aimlessly about.
</p>

<p>
A laugh called him to himself.  In the semilight near
the ballroom entrance stood the Señorita Mendoza.
Mischief sparkled in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Señor the Captain, are you playing blind-man's-buff
with yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"O, señorita mia, only a game of solitaire."
</p>

<p>
"A game of solitaire!" rippled Carmelita.  "What
a diversion for a ball!  Señor Comandante, it is not
permitted here."
</p>

<p>
A bevy of laughing young women came to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Lucinda, come, and Alfreda, and all you girls,"
called Carmelita.  "I have here a caballero captain who
needs our attention.  Señoritas doñas, come quickly."
</p>

<p>
Directly they were all fluttering around Morando.
</p>

<p>
Fathers, mothers, and dueñas paused in their
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"The soldier is captive," from Señora Moraga.  "Let
us see how the children deal with him."
</p>

<p>
"The captive is little worried," commented Señor
Zelaya.
</p>

<p>
"As art thou, Pedro," said Higuera.  "Thou hast
thirty years and no wife.  Thy heart should worry
thee."
</p>

<p>
The señoritas led the Captain into the ballroom, and
halted under one of the chandeliers.
</p>

<p>
"Will the Captain have gifts of gold and silver?
Does the incense of friendship delight him?" asked
Doña Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant questions from a fair questioner, señorita."
</p>

<p>
"Yes or no, Señor Captain," chorused the señoritas.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, emphatically."
</p>

<p>
A score of eggshells, filled with bits of silver and
golden paper, were broken on his head and uniform.
Not until the little baskets, expeditiously handed the
girls by peonas, were empty did the bombardment cease.
</p>

<p>
Those looking on laughed and applauded.
</p>

<p>
"Brava!  Brava!  Captain," some one cried.  "You
are courageous."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, and calm in this baptism of fire," from
another.
</p>

<p>
"To a mirror!  Let Captain Morando take view of
the new uniform given him by the señoritas," a third.
</p>

<p>
Young and old sportively crowded around Morando
and pushed him in front of a long glass.  He was
spangled from head to foot with white and yellow
sheen, all gorgeous over the dark background of his
uniform.
</p>

<p>
"A speech!  A speech!  Some word of thanks!"
insisted the company.
</p>

<p>
Silence was not easily found in that care-free
gathering.  Finally Morando could be heard.
</p>

<p>
"Señoritas, and all my friends, I am happy to wear
the colors that speak of sunrise.  It is a double pleasure
to receive such rare insignia from hands the fairest
in the land."
</p>

<p>
"A good word, Captain!  A good word!" exclaimed
Abelardo Peralta.  "Not all your vigils are spent at
the shrine of war."
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza entered.  "The musicians are idle.
Motionless the feet of señorita and caballero.  Why
no dancing?"
</p>

<p>
"The goddess of wealth has listened to Captain
Morando," informed Pedro Zelaya.  "The sweet odor of
his gratefulness floats around.  The rest of us wonder
and envy."
</p>

<p>
"Captain, turn the tables," from Mendoza.  "Let
not the señoritas bear all before them."  To a peona,
"Naomi, bring more eggs."
</p>

<p>
The eggs were passed around by dainty basketfuls
to the young men who singled out their lady-loves and
generously bespangled them with the confetti which,
moist from scented waters, clung where it fell.
</p>

<p>
The señoritas, hair down their backs, flitted about
like iridescent butterflies.  Neither were they idle in
egg-breaking.  Demurely they would divert a caballero's
attention, then quickly break a shell on his hair, coat
or vest.
</p>

<p>
The men soon shone in colors as resplendent as those
of the señoritas.
</p>

<p>
Perfume filled the air.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza signaled the musicians.  The opening notes
of the grand march sounded.  The egg-breaking
ceased.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza and his daughter led the march.
Dance after dance followed in quick succession.
</p>

<p>
"The merriment tempts not my son of late," said
Señora Zelaya.  "He is over in that corner talking politics
with men a decade his senior.  It is politics, always
politics, with him now."
</p>

<p>
"Relations strain between Mexico and the United
States of America.  If there comes a break, California
must be affected.  Your son, Señora Zelaya, and all
good Californians, each day are searching carefully the
political horizon."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo came to them with heavy step.
</p>

<p>
"I hear, Moraga, you play a clever hand at cribbage.
I haven't met my match at that since I've been in
California.  Come to the card room with me and try this
thing out.  What say?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm at your disposal, Colonel, but distrust comes to
me when I think of contesting my small knowledge of
the game against your undoubted excellence."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you over the cards of the players I've bested
in Europe.  Let us go now."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Barcelo," from Señora Moraga, "are we
likely to have war?"
</p>

<p>
"Señora, you are not the tenth, nor even the
twentieth, who has come up and asked me that question
this evening."
</p>

<p>
The portly Colonel extended his chest.  "Now, I cannot,
of course, speak of private or official information.
No man, no real man, you understand, in my position
would do so.  But I will say that the combined position
of comandante and acting governor-general gives me
rare opportunities to become acquainted with the exact
state of affairs.  You understand me, of course,
señora.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," rather faintly from Señora Moraga.
</p>

<p>
"Well, where was I when interrupted?  O yes.  This
question of war.  I'll simply say no force&mdash;no force,
mind you&mdash;could ever take Monterey, the capital.  Our
swivel guns at the castle rake sea- and land-approach.
We are absolutely impregnable."
</p>

<p>
"But the rest of us&mdash;of the country outside the
capital?" again ventured Señora Moraga.
</p>

<p>
"No enemy of sense would care a feather for a country
if the capital could not be taken.  In other words,
we are another Gibraltar.  Come, Moraga, I always
make it a practice to say as little as possible on these
subjects to the señoras.  They are easily alarmed.  To
the card room let us go, Moraga."
</p>

<p>
The men departed.
</p>

<p>
"May I serve you a mint lemonade?" asked Morando
of Carmelita when the music had stopped.
</p>

<p>
She was willing.
</p>

<p>
A peon brought the refreshing drink.
</p>

<p>
He bent over the girl, carefully anticipating her each
want.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña, the sugar? and more lemon juice?
Good!  Now a spoon."
</p>

<p>
"Forget not yourself, Señor Comandante."
</p>

<p>
Soon he too was served.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña, may I speak to you?  I cannot refrain."
</p>

<p>
She smiled at him over the edge of her glass.  "It
seems to me you have been speaking to me for some
time.  The thoughts are bubbling up which the dance
set free, as you said in the garden a while ago.  Is it
not so?"  She laughed.
</p>

<p>
The Captain signaled a passing peona who removed
the emptied goblets.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Carmelita, pray take my words seriously.
I think of you, and I dream of you.  Your image is
enshrined in my heart.  Before it I do homage.  O,
Señorita Doña, I offer you the best devotion of a
soldier whose greatest hope is to love and to cherish you,
and to make you happy.  Will you not listen?"
</p>

<p>
She blushed and her hands trembled slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Speak to me, Doña.  Bid me hope, even ever so little.
The endeavor of my life shall be to become worthy of
you.  Will you not say there is hope for me?"
</p>

<p>
Intensity blazed in the eyes of the handsome soldier,
and gave resonance to his voice.  He took the girl's
hand.  She but half resisted.
</p>

<p>
The settee which they occupied was partly screened
by palms from the rest of the ballroom.  A bevy of
señoritas, passing through during the intermission,
exchanged knowing glances as they came in sight of the
two, and went on.  The man and woman did not notice
them.
</p>

<p>
"O, Carmelita, will you not answer me when I say
I love you? and tell me in return that you love me?
Will you not, Carmelita mia?"
</p>

<p>
She did not try to withdraw her hand.  Her eyelids
drooped, and the color of the rose swam anew in her
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"O, Carmelita, beloved of my heart, say you love me,"
rapturously.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to interrupt you, but music for the waltz has
begun, and I have the honor to be your partner."
</p>

<p>
It was Patricio Martinez, who bore Carmelita away
with him to the waiting dance.
</p>

<p>
Morando spoke in a low tone to her: "I'll see you
again presently.  May I not?"
</p>

<p>
It was not easy for him to see her again soon.
The young gallants crowded around her begging for
dances, or pressing their favors on her during the rest
times.
</p>

<p>
Morando danced several times, then left the ballroom
and wandered through the reception rooms, joining a
group of men who were discussing the possibilities of
wheat-raising in the Santa Clara Valley; then, another
coterie who debated the relative merits of Alta California
and Baja California.  Finally, he became one of a
company gathered around Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"We change location, but not scenes," she said to
him.  "One might well fancy himself in Madrid to-night
instead of Mission San José."
</p>

<p>
"It is so, señora."
</p>

<p>
After a little Morando continued wandering, until he
came to the conservatory where he sat down.
</p>

<p>
"I'll remain here till Carmelita is disengaged," was his
thought.  "She almost listened to me.  If she accepts
me, I'll be the happiest man in the world."
</p>

<p>
He spoke half aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Your voice, Señor Capitan, tells me you are here.
Otherwise, I might have missed you.  What a cozy
retreat you have amid these branching ferns!"
</p>

<p>
It was Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
The Captain's full height bowed to the lady.
</p>

<p>
"Will you not be seated, señora?  Pardon me for not
seeing you sooner."
</p>

<p>
"The pardon is yours.  Will you not, also, be seated?"
making room for him at her side.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you.  The favor of your company honors
me greatly."
</p>

<p>
The señora inclined her head.  The gems in her hair
gleamed responsively to the bright lights.  The white
silk of her gown lay softly against the vivid green of the
ferns.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Capitan, I am impelled to come and talk with you."
</p>

<p>
"My dear lady, I am honored."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to make appeal to you."
</p>

<p>
She looked straight into the man's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, if I can do anything for you, I
am thereby most happy."
</p>

<p>
"Many thanks, Señor Soldier.  I shall begin."
</p>

<p>
Morando was all attention.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Capitan, the traditions, the art, the faith of
Spain live very near to my heart.  They have made old
Spain glorious.  The world's history would be vastly
poorer without them."
</p>

<p>
"Truly, señora."
</p>

<p>
"This province, even now, is smiling under their
influence.  The future has splendid things in store for us
here if the heritage from across the sea has way
unimpeded.  May there not be another Castile beside
this Western coast only less magnificent than the
first?"
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, you give my own thoughts."
</p>

<p>
"I rejoice, Señor Capitan.  But on whom rests the
duty of safeguarding this heritage?  Is it not on us, the
sons and daughters of Castile?"
</p>

<p>
"Most unquestionably, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Then, let us exert ourselves.  Political unrest is
agitating the people.  It is as yet formless, but soon it
must flow in settled stream, for men's thoughts, like
water, always seek their level.  Señor Soldier, the part
of every lover of Castile is plain."
</p>

<p>
"Please say further, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Mexico and California soon go their separate ways.
Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it is."
</p>

<p>
"The world moves, Captain Morando, and California
must move with it.  Whither do we go?"
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for reply she went on: "Public
opinion can be so molded that it will take us to the
protection of either the United States of America or to
Great Britain.  Great Britain would willingly let
flourish here Spanish ideals.  Read the history of her
dependencies.  Captain Morando, our obligations to
Spain, to this province, to ourselves, demand that we
lead the people to ask the coming of the British flag."
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, many are speaking of these matters.
The necessity for some action is forcing itself.
But the United States lies nearest us.  Their government
is republican, the same in form as that to which
the people here are accustomed."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Capitan.  I have been in the capital of the
United States with my attaché husband.  Two years
ago what did I hear?  It was a question of Texas
coming into their Union.  Even the great ones said, 'Let
us drive the Mexicans and Spaniards across the Rio
Grande, then to perdition!'"
</p>

<p>
Morando did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"They would not deal differently with us in California.
Let come the United States and all vestige of
Spanish civilization will be obliterated, and another
foreign to it will be installed.  Great Britain would be
our protector.  Why chance the coming of disaster?"
</p>

<p>
"Señora, you have thought wondrously deep."
</p>

<p>
"Why not act, and act now?  Public sentiment is in
pliable condition.  Who knows how long it will so
continue?  Do your part, Señor Soldier, in organizing a
general desire that our province seek Great Britain's
friendly arm.  Spanish chivalry calls to you."
</p>

<p>
"You speak strongly."
</p>

<p>
"Not more strongly than the occasion demands.  The
welfare of this province, the faith of our fathers, the
culture of centuries, are at stake.  The United States
of America is awake.  That mighty nation has her
agents among our people, persuading them, leading
them, exhorting them.  Señor Soldier, be up and doing."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, come what may, I shall not fail this province."
</p>

<p>
He touched the hilt of his sword.
</p>

<p>
"The splendid womanhood of California will crown
you their knight, my soldier."
</p>

<p>
They arose and walked away.  In the doorway they
paused.
</p>

<p>
"For Castile and this province!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"By my sword and glove, señora!"
</p>

<p>
She extended her hand.  He met it in firm grasp.
</p>

<p>
The call for supper had been made, but they had not
heard.
</p>

<p>
The company was around them.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Captain!  Ah, señora! what have we here?  a
betrothal?"
</p>

<p>
Carmelita Mendoza, with her father, was but a pace
away.
</p>

<p>
"Friends, friends, to the supper room!" called the
host.
</p>

<p>
The guests obeyed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br />
AT THE SUPPER
</h3>

<p>
"My friends, nature prepares a generous harvest
against the months of winter.  Let us enjoy the
good things at table in anticipation of our share of that
harvest.  Amigos, to our seats!"
</p>

<p>
Thus spoke Mendoza to the company assembled in
the dining hall.
</p>

<p>
This room was a little smaller than the ballroom, and
its finish was of polished oak combined with redwood.
The tables ran nearly the length of the apartment.
</p>

<p>
The products of Mendoza's gardens and hothouses
had been levied on to furnish adornment.  Cut roses
tumbled in profusion from vases arranged along the
middle of the tables, while potted palms cast shadows
from chandeliers and wall-candles.  Ivy shaped itself
into an archway over the entrance, crept through the
foliage of house shrubs lining the walls, and intertwined
here and there into bowers of ease.  Against the
green vine, flowers, rivaling the rainbow in tints, sang
in color notes the jubilation of California's spring.
</p>

<p>
The people enjoyed the midnight supper.  The cooling
air of the courtyard, the dance, the animated
conversation had whetted the appetites to an edge.
</p>

<p>
Finding place not in any particular order, but in the
company their preference sought, as was the way in
these large gatherings, the girls, with their dueñas, and
the gallants were mostly at one end of the room, leaving
the graver portion of the assembly by itself.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza was at the head of a table.  At its
foot was his daughter.  Near him was the wisdom of the
valley, represented by the heads of families.  Morando
wished to seat himself at the señorita's right hand, but
she had already motioned Abelardo Peralta to that
place.  On her left was Alfreda Castro.
</p>

<p>
The soldier found himself next to young Peralta, and
directly opposite Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"I have a budding magnolia by my plate," burst out
Lolita Hernandez.  "My partner shall wear it for a
button-hole bouquet.  He lacks only that.  Come, I'll
put it on you."
</p>

<p>
The youth by her side was nothing loth.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña," spoke her dueña, who was on the
other side, "what can you mean?  A nosegay so large
emulates the cabbage.  Why not use this Castilian rose?
Behold, it blushes for you," laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Doña, even a cabbage in Señorita Hernandez's
hands would thereby become beautiful," from the youth.
</p>

<p>
"How easily young men's tongues frame compliments!"
from the dueña.
</p>

<p>
"They have worthy subjects here," from another
youth, waving his hand toward the señoritas.
</p>

<p>
The dueña laughed again.  "Young people are
unmanageable these days," she concluded.
</p>

<p>
"Señor the Capitan Morando did not enjoy the
egg-breaking?" inquired young Peralta.
</p>

<p>
"We enjoyed it," laughed Lolita without waiting for
Morando's reply.
</p>

<p>
"I broke an egg on your hair, señorita.  I see the gold
and silver adornment still," rallied Peralta.
</p>

<p>
"I broke three on your vest, Señor Peralta.  I'm
sorry you could not have preserved the pattern,"
returned Lolita.
</p>

<p>
"But the Señor Capitan and the egg-breaking&mdash;was
it new to you?" continued Don Abelardo.
</p>

<p>
"It was unexpected to me here, but not new," from
Morando.  "Spain observes it on such occasions as
this."
</p>

<p>
"Ask the Señor Capitan about heart-breaking,"
laughed the ungovernable Lolita.  "Perhaps he has
practiced that too in Spain."
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña Hernandez!" warningly from her
dueña.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am as curious to know about that as was
Don Abelardo about egg-breaking."
</p>

<p>
"Practice makes perfect, is that your meaning?"
smiled Señora Valentino at her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;no.  I simply asked for information."
</p>

<p>
"Is the Señorita Hernandez still heart-whole?" inquired
the soldier.  "If she is not, it is not the fault of
my sex, I know."
</p>

<p>
"Do you speak from the fullness of experience, Señor
Capitan?" asked Señorita Mendoza.  Those in hearing
laughed gayly at the quip, as did Morando.  Nevertheless,
an arctic breath seemed to touch him.
</p>

<p>
The elders gave themselves to other subjects&mdash;the
grain and the vineyard prospects for the year, the
return of their herds from the San Joaquin, and the like.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo's voice was heard talking over his
contest at cribbage with Moraga.
</p>

<p>
The serving peons finished their work and were standing
idly by the door.  The guests had eaten their fill.
The room rang with merriment.  Many of the señoritas
had woven flowers from the tables into wreaths and were
wearing them on the head or around the neck.  Lolita
Hernandez wished to crown her partner with roses, but
the youth, with mock humility, demurred.
</p>

<p>
"Thrice did even the great Cæsar refuse a crown,"
he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to the lore of the traveler," laughed Peralta.
</p>

<p>
The other had just returned from a year at college
in Honolulu.  "The fourth offer I might accept," he
said.
</p>

<p>
Lolita promptly placed the wreath on his head.  "I
crown you king of heartbreakers," but looking at Morando.
</p>

<p>
"I salute the king," proclaimed the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Whom shall I crown queen of heart-breakers?"
Lolita went on.
</p>

<p>
"Crown yourself," from her partner.  "Señorita, the
honor should be yours."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" in pretended severity.
</p>

<p>
"All hearts fall before you," sweeping his arm toward
the company.  "Crown yourself; nay, I'll crown you."
</p>

<p>
He removed the garland from his own head and attempted
to place it on Lolita's.  She resisted.  The
señoritas and the gallants laughed and cheered loudly.
Finally she took it from his hand and held it aloft.
</p>

<p>
"I appeal to the company here present; who is the
queen of heart-breakers?  This crown is looking for a
wearer."
</p>

<p>
"Alfreda Castro!  Carmelita Mendoza!  Ysobel Soto!
Señora Valentino!" came from the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"The Señora Valentino should have it.  She has
overcome the Captain Morando.  'Sword and glove' has he
surrendered to her.  It was at the door of the supper
room.  I saw it.  Señora Valentino, the wreath is
thine."
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña Hernandez!" remonstrated her
dueña.  "Remember the señora is not a maid as art
thou.  Have care for thy tongue."
</p>

<p>
Lolita started toward Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"Come back, Señorita Lolita," from the dueña.
</p>

<p>
Lolita partly turned, but Señora Valentino was
laughing, in evident enjoyment of the fun.  Reassured,
the girl called to the company:
</p>

<p>
"Shall it not be the señora?'
</p>

<p>
"The Señora Valentino!" they cried.  "Our fair guest
from Spain!  Honor her!  Crown her queen of
heart-breakers!"
</p>

<p>
The señora smiled sweetly at the joyous throng, as
much at home in the frolic as anyone among them.
</p>

<p>
Lolita placed the wreath on the señora's head.  "As
thy friends acclaim, so I do.  You are pronounced queen
of heart-breakers."
</p>

<p>
What reply the señora made could not be heard for
the applause, but she kissed first one hand, then the
other, to the señoritas and the caballeros.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza was standing by his place at the table.  He
motioned again and again for silence before it was
obtained.  Finally they listened to him.
</p>

<p>
"To the ballroom for you youngsters!  Come with me."
</p>

<p>
"Will you stay with us in the ballroom, señor?  We
want you," laughed a girl.
</p>

<p>
"I'll start you going in the dance, then return to the
table.  We elders like to linger a while over our coffee
and burnt brandy.  But come now, children."
</p>

<p>
They followed him through the green archway into
the ballroom.
</p>

<p>
When the señor had left the supper room, taking the
younger contingent with him, the others had moved toward
his end of the table.  Barcelo insisted that Moraga
should at once accompany him to the card room; whereupon
rather reluctantly Moraga left his old friends.
</p>

<p>
Marcel Hernandez arose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Fellow rancheros, and your ladies," bowing
gallantly, "Señor Mendoza, occupied with the young
people, is temporarily absent from the room&mdash;he is quite
a boy, is the señor&mdash;and I take occasion to say a word
to you.  The old government here is worn out, ready
to fall to pieces like a used-up carreta.  We, the leaders
of the people, must find another government&mdash;find
another; yes, and soon.  We have talked it over this
evening; in fact, have talked of little else for weeks and
months.  Let us take action to-night."
</p>

<p>
He sat down deliberately.
</p>

<p>
A half dozen men sprang to their feet.  All dignity
was thrown aside, and they raised their voices and
gesticulated earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"It is not yet the time," called one.
</p>

<p>
"It is the time, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Another drowned him out by shouting, "Let us seek
adequate protection from some great nation which will
insure us life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
</p>

<p>
"Mexico falls soon before the United States.  We
shall be declared contraband of war and suffer the
consequences, unless we act quickly and in the right
direction," asserted yet another.
</p>

<p>
Don Louis Valencia arose.
</p>

<p>
"Friends, you speak wisely.  Nothing more need be
said.  Let us act.  I say, make our province a
dependency of Great Britain.  That country will protect
us.  Señors, now is the time.  Great Britain will be our
ally and friend.  I repeat, take action&mdash;and now!"
thumping his fist on the table.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza returned from the ballroom at that
moment.  He went to his chair at the table.  All
became silent.
</p>

<p>
They waited for him to speak on the matter which
was occupying so much attention in California.  The
stillness became intense.
</p>

<p>
"Neighbors and friends," Mendoza said at last,
"what I heard as I entered tells me the import of the
debate which evidently took place while I was absent.
I hope nothing will come to head at present."
</p>

<p>
"It must come to head!" from Hernandez.  "Why
not take the bull by the horns?" looking at Higuera.  "I
mean, why not take initiative here and now?  It is
unsafe to wait."
</p>

<p>
Valencia seconded Hernandez's words.
</p>

<p>
"The wise traveler," counseled Mendoza, "surveys an
unknown way rood by rood.  Señor Hernandez and
friends, before taking positive action we should consider
the path along which we would find ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"It is either the United States or England," argued
Valencia.  "No other nation need be considered.  Why
not declare for one or the other before another
day?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, neighbor Valencia, quite right!"
supported Hernandez.
</p>

<p>
"The rest of the province is undecided, as we have
been.  We now know our minds.  Let us speak them.
The others will follow, and the vexed question is at
an end," again from Valencia.
</p>

<p>
"But do we know our minds well enough to speak
them?" questioned Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"We do!  We do!" replied Valencia.
</p>

<p>
"Huzza!  Huzza!" shouted Hernandez.
</p>

<p>
"Better consider!" cautioned Higuera.
</p>

<p>
"Slowness never wins the race," retorted Valencia.
</p>

<p>
"The tortoise won the race from the hare," rebutted
Higuera.
</p>

<p>
The dancing had not held all those who had gone with
Señor Mendoza to the ballroom.  The atmosphere
around the table of the elders was surcharged with
subtle influence which drew many back.  By twos and
threes they came.  Señora Valentino and Abelardo
Peralta were among them; Captain Morando also.
</p>

<p>
"Prepare to become an English province," now from
young Peralta.
</p>

<p>
Not a few were of that conviction.  "England is just.
England allows her dependencies to flourish in their own
way," they declared.
</p>

<p>
"Huzza!  Huzza!" again shouted Hernandez.  "Viva
England!"
</p>

<p>
Morando arose.
</p>

<p>
"I make no preference save this," he said.  "We must
preserve here Spanish ideals, Spanish manhood and
womanhood."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent!" commended the host.  "Splendid!"
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!" echoed Señora Valentino, clapping her
hands.
</p>

<p>
The women followed her example.  "Yes, yes, Spanish
manhood and womanhood!" they exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The Señorita Carmelita came to her father's chair.
</p>

<p>
"Papacito, the time soon comes for El Son.  We
await you in the ballroom."
</p>

<p>
"At once, little one."
</p>

<p>
The elders left the table, and the entire company
moved toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"For Castilian manhood and womanhood in this
province!" Señora Valentino said to Morando.
</p>

<p>
"Sword and glove!" enthusiastically in return.
</p>

<p>
Again their palms met in compact.
</p>

<p>
For the second time that evening Carmelita saw the
fervent hand-clasp.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br />
CARMELITA DANCES EL SON
</h3>

<p>
By custom the dance of El Son followed supper.
Peons pared wax from candles and scattered the
particles over the ballroom floor.  Smooth as it had
been before it must be made more so for the dance El
Son.  The Indian men and women worked the wax into
the wood until the surface shone like the beams of a
harvest moon.
</p>

<p>
"A little more wax by you there, Clotilda&mdash;not that
side, the other!" ordered the peon in charge.  "Now, be
alive with your foot.  Use judgment!  Use judgment!
Don't wear a hole in the floor.  Now, more wax where
your toes were digging!"
</p>

<p>
"Already as many candles are in the shavings, Tomaso,
as would make a display for Holy Thursday,"
remonstrated a peona.
</p>

<p>
"What have we here?  What have we here?" indignantly
from Tomaso.  "All masters, and no servants?
Obey my word, and be quick about it!  Move yourselves,
every one of you!  Make the floor glisten.  The more it
shines the more slippery it is.  Did you not hear some
of the company clamoring that our doña herself dance
El Son to-night?"
</p>

<p>
Tomaso was Señor Mendoza's trusty man, an Indian
of intelligence and fidelity.  He was captain of the
Señor's fighting peons and had been Carmelita's
postilion at the merienda race.  Under his rapid orders the
servants made the floor ready.  Mendoza, however, was
not satisfied with it.
</p>

<p>
"The floor is not yet right for El Son.  It needs a
dance thereon.  Friends, let us have a waltz!"
</p>

<p>
The caballeros sought partners, looking for their
lady loves over grounds, reception rooms, and conservatory.
Morando found Carmelita chatting vivaciously
in the midst of a gay party.
</p>

<p>
"Will you favor me with this waltz, señorita doña?"
</p>

<p>
"It is yours, Captain Morando."
</p>

<p>
In a moment they were one of a hundred couples on
the floor.  The girl's eyes sparkled and the color rose
higher in her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"A wonderful night this has been!" Morando exclaimed
to his partner in the waltz.  "What a pity it
must end so soon!"
</p>

<p>
"You are, then, enjoying the baile?  No?  It will
delight my father, I know, to hear that."
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña, may I have a few moments with you
when this dance is over?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
In a little while they were seated in the quiet of a
reception room.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Carmelita, I told you earlier in the evening
that I love you, and I asked your love in return.  Again
I tell you I love you.  O, doña mia!  Doña mia!  Will
you not accept my love?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him and moved away slightly.
</p>

<p>
"O, Doña Carmelita, will you not answer me?"
</p>

<p>
"The Capitan Morando is insistent."
</p>

<p>
"My heart urges me, señorita doña, my heart filled
with love for you."
</p>

<p>
"The Capitan's love hangs on slender thread."
</p>

<p>
"You, doña mia, can make that thread strong."
</p>

<p>
"I do not choose thus to occupy myself."
</p>

<p>
"O, heart of my heart, accept my love and I will give
my whole life to you."
</p>

<p>
"It is quite time for this interview to end.  Señor
Capitan, will you escort me back to the company?"
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Carmelita, why do you speak in this way?
Have I offended you?"
</p>

<p>
"Possibly you have other questions to ask."
</p>

<p>
"Only one other question concerns me, señorita mia.
Answer me that, I implore of you.  Say that you will
accept my love."
</p>

<p>
He stood before her.  Involuntarily his hand dropped
to the hilt of his sword, as it had done when shortly
before he had been speaking to Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
The girl arose quickly.  "Good evening, Captain
Morando," she said and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Undecided, he looked after her.
</p>

<p>
A hand was laid on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Captain, we meet after El Son in the card
room.  Come into the open with us, and we will explain."
</p>

<p>
It was Valencia who spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, come with us.  We have been looking everywhere
for you," joined in Hernandez.
</p>

<p>
"I am at your service, señors."
</p>

<p>
The music for El Son, low and sobbing, came floating
through the flower-scented air.  This dance, of Spanish,
or, perhaps, of Moorish origin, had elaborated itself in
the new world, personifying in poetry of motion the
joyous spirit of the province.  It belonged to the master
of the house to select the dancer who, if she chose,
might add to the usual figures inventions of her own.
Carmelita appeared at the entrance of the ballroom.
Serving maids and Indian messenger boys were around
her in numbers.  She dispatched them, one by one, to
bring in all the guests.
</p>

<p>
They came from everywhere.  The older men were in
small groups, talking earnestly, and often gesticulating
vehemently.  The young men were mostly with
their sweethearts and the dueñas.  With Señora Valentino
were Valencia, Hernandez, Abelardo Peralta, Patricio
Martinez, and a half dozen others, including
Morando.
</p>

<p>
"We have laid before the Captain our point of view,"
Hernandez was saying.  "Even the charming Señora
Valentino, a stranger here and altogether free from
self-interest, agrees&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
They passed into the ballroom.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza walked up and down the room, pretending
to clap his hands before this señorita, or that,
this being the signal by which the favored one was
notified that she was to set foot to the measures.
Laughter and bantering without stint went around.
</p>

<p>
"Lolita Hernandez!"
</p>

<p>
"Lucinda Higuera!"
</p>

<p>
"Tula Laynez!"
</p>

<p>
"Juanita Calderon!"
</p>

<p>
"Alfreda Castro!" from yet another partisan; and
so on.
</p>

<p>
"The Señorita Carmelita!" cried a dozen voices as
the doña entered.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful!  Beautiful!" exclaimed the usually
phlegmatic Fulgencio Higuera.  "The señorita Mendoza
has stolen the light of stars for her eyes, and she has
robbed the gardens for her cheeks.  Let her dance El
Son."
</p>

<p>
She bowed in appreciation.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you," she said.  Then to her father, "Papacito,
a word."
</p>

<p>
They withdrew.
</p>

<p>
"Will you ask me to dance El Son?"
</p>

<p>
Wondrously beautiful she was, her dark eyes glowing,
the color flaming in her cheeks.  The chivalry of his
young manhood lived again as he saw the resplendent
girl.  Joy leaped in his heart that this exquisite
creature was his daughter.  She stood before him, every
element of her personality pleading.
</p>

<p>
"Please, Papacito!  I wish it to-night more than
anything else."
</p>

<p>
They walked back among the people.  The company
unwittingly seconded her request.
</p>

<p>
"The Señorita Mendoza, the fairest of the fair!  Call
her, señor!  Call her, the lily of the valley!"
</p>

<p>
The old don hesitated.
</p>

<p>
Again came the request from all sides, increasing
insistent.
</p>

<p>
"Papacito, please!" urged the girl in low voice.
</p>

<p>
He clapped his hands before her.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of loud applause she walked to the middle
of the room.
</p>

<p>
The music, now dreamy and insinuating, soon took a
livelier turn.  The young woman glided back and forth
on the waxed floor as lightly as a swallow skims the air.
In willowy movements, hands and feet in perfect
correspondence, she hovered over the cleared space, seeming
scarcely to touch the floor.  Then, in wider step, she
circled over this space in eaglelike sweeps, her arms
outstretched and her long hair floating.
</p>

<p>
Without pausing, the girl's movements became
sinuous, gentle.  She advanced, retreated, again came
forward, as if entreating, but fearing rebuff.  Rare
grace and charm was in every motion.
</p>

<p>
"Brava!  Brava!" shouted the men, while above all
was heard the excited voice of Morando.
</p>

<p>
With arms extended she fluttered from side to side,
as a butterfly sipping honey from flower-cups here and
there, staying but an instant at any one.
</p>

<p>
Her hand made gesture to the musicians.
</p>

<p>
The strain became bold, quick, martial.
</p>

<p>
She spun on her toe-tips, her long dress billowing, her
hair streaming.  As she whirled, her feet described
winding figures on the floor, her skirts repeating the design.
</p>

<p>
More and more quickly Carmelita circled over the room.
</p>

<p>
Louder crashed the music, and more hearty became
the plaudits.
</p>

<p>
Fulgencio Higuera drew from his pocket a handful
of gold pieces, and flung them at the señorita's feet.
Another, another, a dozen others, followed his example.
</p>

<p>
"Brava!  Brava!" cried Marcel Hernandez, tossing
handfuls of gold to the ceiling.  The pieces fell among
the enthusiastic company, who scarcely noticed the
glittering shower.
</p>

<p>
Still, the doña sped on her toes, her skirt still
marking in ampler pattern the lines fashioned by her feet.
Her very being undulated in response to the weird
music.
</p>

<p>
The applause hushed for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"C-A-R-M-E-L-I-T-A M-E-N-D-O-Z-A," some one
spelled the tracing, letter by letter.  "Carmelita
Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
The clamor broke out afresh.
</p>

<p>
"She has worked her name on the ballroom floor, as
part of the dance!  Viva!  Viva!" they shouted.  "Viva!
Viva!"
</p>

<p>
The doña again fluttered up and down, arms outstretched.
</p>

<p>
The caballeros rushed around the girl shouting and
praising her.  More gold was freely scattered, its jingle
intermingling with the orchestra.
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!  Splendid!  Is it not so, Señora Valentino?"
came from Captain Morando.  Without pausing
for reply he hastened to Carmelita, who was surrounded
by numberless congratulating friends.
</p>

<p>
"O, doña mia," the Captain cried, "you dance with
the grace of an angel."
</p>

<p>
"The most successful rendition of El Son in a
decade!" added a dueña.
</p>

<p>
"The most perfect ever," again from Morando.
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino came up all smiles.  "This ball is
the rarest treat of my visit to California, and your
El Son, señorita, is the choice incident of the evening's
pleasure.  I thank you for it."
</p>

<p>
"You are very good, señora.  I am glad that I can
help in entertaining you."
</p>

<p>
The music for a mazurka was beginning.  The older
men disappeared from the room.  Morando, Peralta,
Martinez, and a number of others soon followed, while
the rest were again at the dance.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo and Moraga returned to the card
room and finished their nearly completed round of
cribbage.
</p>

<p>
"A piece of luck, Moraga.  Simply a confounded
piece of luck.  It happens occasionally."
</p>

<p>
"I've won five out of six games from you to-night,
Colonel."
</p>

<p>
"Chance threw the cards your way.  My skill simply
went for nothing&mdash;went for nothing!"
</p>

<p>
The card room rapidly filled.  After a few moments
of cursory conversation there was silence.  Each was
waiting for another to speak.
</p>

<p>
Valencia began.
</p>

<p>
"Señors," with much deliberation, "at supper the
sense of the majority of the assemblage was that we
take our province from the tutelage of Mexico to the
protection of Great Britain.  The question before us
is, How shall we proceed to make this transfer?  Let
us hear from you."
</p>

<p>
Hernandez arose.
</p>

<p>
"Send a delegation to the English representative in
Monterey, and tell him of our desires.  A British fleet
is near.  Let it take possession of the province.  Then,
if Mexico objects, she will have Great Britain to deal
with."
</p>

<p>
Most of the men nodded affirmatively.
</p>

<p>
Hernandez took his seat with a satisfied air.
</p>

<p>
"Friends," said Mendoza, "I am not of the mind
that it is wise to take action in this matter to-night.
Too great haste in acting is like a too hot fire in
cooking."
</p>

<p>
Higuera, Zelaya, and a few others signified they were
in agreement with this.
</p>

<p>
"My friends, action is the word!" cried Hernandez.
"Positive action!  Prompt action!  Mexico stands at
our gates collecting taxes, giving nothing in return,
like the robbers at Tarifa.  Drop Mexico, I say, and
join hands with England, at once!"
</p>

<p>
"As English subjects a mighty future is ours.  Let
us not wait," from Abelardo Peralta.
</p>

<p>
"The young men will have opportunities then," followed
Miguel Soto.  "An English prime minister ruled
his political world when he was twenty-one."
</p>

<p>
"Why not find from the United States, and from
Great Britain as well, the conditions under which they
will receive our province?  We can then act more
intelligently."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" chorused many.  "England!  England!
Become English subjects at once."
</p>

<p>
Hernandez jumped to his feet.  "Become British
subjects at once!" waving his hand.
</p>

<p>
Others, and yet others, followed his example, till the
place fairly rang with the shouting.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza rapped on a table.  After quiet was restored
he began: "Señors, we have in Baja California
men like Carillo and the brothers Pico.  Unless we allow
them a part in our deliberations they will repudiate any
action we may take.  England does not want a province
with divided sentiment.  Carillo and the brothers Pico
are capable of inciting Southern California to rebellion,
if we attempt to turn over the province to England
without consulting them."
</p>

<p>
"Good friends, no embarrassment need be feared
from Carillo, nor from the brothers Pico."  With these
words Señora Valentino floated into the room, her
upturned face wreathed in smiles.
</p>

<p>
The company, surprised at the sound of her voice,
turned questioningly.
</p>

<p>
"I think Carillo, likewise the brothers Pico, can be
relied on to espouse your wish to transfer allegiance to
England."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza spoke: "Respected lady, these absent gentlemen
must be given a chance to speak for themselves.
Giving away provinces is more than child's play.  We
cannot hazard guesses."
</p>

<p>
"My ever-wise Administrator, you are right.  It
occurs to me that these same brothers Pico and Señor
Carillo have in some slight manner expressed themselves
as favorable to this English protectorate which we all
are so anxious to bring about."
</p>

<p>
"But, good señora, mere hearsay must not be accepted."
</p>

<p>
"Again, right as ever, most worthy Administrator.
But, to recollect further&mdash;I believe I have in my
possession a letter from these señors&mdash;possibly, two or
three letters&mdash;as I recall the matter more closely.  These
same letters, if I mistake not, declare quite plainly as to
the sentiments of the writers."
</p>

<p>
"But, Señora Valentino, there must be no possibility
of mistake in such an issue as this."
</p>

<p>
With childlike simplicity she looked into the face of
Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"I remember fully now.  These Southerners express
unequivocally their desire to make California a British
province.  They assure us they will spare no pains to
bring about this consummation."
</p>

<p>
"But, señora, pardon: would I presume should I ask
further enlightenment?"
</p>

<p>
Again she smiled.  "Señor, your Excellency, you do
not presume.  These communications from Señors
Carillo and the Pico brothers were merely little private
scribbles, from one sojourner to another, so to speak,
and in which there happened to be mention of the
political unrest now occupying the minds of the sterner
sex."  Her smile broadened.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo had been looking through the cards
of the last hand at cribbage, hoping to come across
errors in his opponent's play.  He found none.  "This
question should have been settled long ago," he said,
testily.  "Let the British admiral bring his fleet into
Monterey Harbor.  Down comes the Mexican flag and
up goes the Union Jack.  Mexico cannot resist, having
no ships.  I wonder I did not think of having this done
before."
</p>

<p>
He took his seat, and again looked through the cards.
</p>

<p>
Renewed enthusiasm now possessed the company.
They applauded and shouted; and cheered Señora
Valentino and Colonel Barcelo.  When quiet came a
committee was chosen to acquaint the English
representative at Monterey of California's wish.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Moraga," challenged Colonel Barcelo, "let
us play again."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel, you would pass a province from hand to
hand as unconcernedly as you do these pasteboards,"
uttered Moraga, taking his place at the card table.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly!  Certainly!  This change has really been
in my mind some time.  Just crept in, so I hardly
noticed it."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel and the land baron were soon engrossed
with the game.  The other guests sauntered away.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later Carmelita chanced to see
Tomaso, captain of her father's fighting peons, riding
away on Mercurio, the wheel horse in the merienda race.
Following, on a reata, was the big bay leader of the
Mendoza team.  The Indian had stripped to the waist,
and wore only the leathern knee breeches of the peon
jockey.  A handkerchief was tied tightly around the
head to keep in place his long hair.  Neither horse was
saddled, having only a surcingle about its body.
</p>

<p>
The rattle of hoofs on the hard road sounded loud
in the night, then died out.
</p>

<p>
The girl knew that Tomaso was bent on some errand
of great interest to her father.  The two swift horses,
prepared as they were, meant that the Indian would,
if necessary, ride one to exhaustion, then use the other
to complete his journey.
</p>

<p>
The night waned.  Noises of early morning began to
echo in the hills.  The dance and merriment went on.
Faint tracings of dawn came across the eastern horizon.
The Mendoza ball was drawing to its close.  Light came
on wings of morning.
</p>

<p>
Peons brought carreta and horse.  Señor Mendoza
and his daughter stood at the courtyard gate to wish
Godspeed to the departing guests.  "Adios, Señor
Mendoza!  Adios, Señorita Mendoza!" was heard on every
side.
</p>

<p>
Father and daughter watched neighbor and friend
go their way.
</p>

<p>
Rapidly galloping horses were approaching from the
direction of the eastern hills.  Two horsemen were soon
at the gate.  One was Tomaso astride the big bay leader
trembling from the ride.  The other was O'Donnell on
his stallion.
</p>

<p>
"Buenos días, Señor O'Donnell," greeted Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell returned, "Good morning," adding with
rising reflection, "Well?"
</p>

<p>
"The Señor O'Donnell and I have pressing business,
my daughter.  Please excuse us, carita mia."
</p>

<p>
The señorita bowed.
</p>

<p>
The men went into Mendoza's private office.
</p>

RETURNING FROM THE BALL
</h3>

<p>
"My Captain, it has been a goodly night, one long
to be remembered."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino and Captain Morando were riding
along the rolling highway which led southerly from the
Mission San José.  A large portion of the company that
had attended the ball traveled this same road, the men
on their mounts, the women-folks mostly in carretas,
though two or three, like Señora Valentino, preferred
horseback.
</p>

<p>
"Our Mendoza is a lavish host.  He does nothing by
halves, like the worthy Californian that he is."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! yes.  A wonderful man!  A wonderful man!"
</p>

<p>
The señora reined in her horse.  A rabbit, pursued
by a hawk, was running toward them from the underbrush
at the side.  Double and dodge as it might, the
little beast could not rid itself of its persecutor.
Finally it lay, a little crumpled heap, not far from the
señorita's horse, squealing for mercy.  It found none,
for the bird of prey drove its talons into the fur and
started to carry away its victim.
</p>

<p>
The señora swung her horse in wide curve and struck
the hawk with her riding-whip.  It dropped the rabbit
and flew fiercely at her.  She struck it again, this time
with the butt of the whip.  It circled away, but
returned to the attack and was hovering over the lady
when Morando killed it with a pistol shot.
</p>

<p>
It was the occurrence of a moment; but the angry
challenge of the hawk and the report of the firearm
called the attention of the horseback riders as well as
the dozing occupants of the carretas.  Men shouted
and women screamed.  The peon riflemen came hurrying
up, ready for battle.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, are you hurt?" solicitously inquired Morando.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much.  A little scratch."
</p>

<p>
"Let us dismount.  You are pale.  Let me assist you."
</p>

<p>
She gave him her uninjured hand and loosed her feet
from the stirrup.  Twilight fell across her eyes,
resolving into huge, unsteady clouds swimming around
and around her with increasing velocity.  In dead faint
she sank into Morando's arms.
</p>

<p>
The Captain removed the señora's long riding-glove,
and found her wrist profusely bleeding from a small,
but deep, perforation.  The hawk had driven its talon
in, full length.
</p>

<p>
"Come, amigos," Morando cried, "prepare a temporary
couch for Señora Valentino by the roadside."
</p>

<p>
A dozen ponchos fell from caballeros' shoulders, and
the women improvised a comfortable bed from them on
the thickly interwoven green grass, the soldier holding
the insensible woman in his arms the while.  He laid
her, still fainting, on the bed, softly odorous of the
growing things about.
</p>

<p>
In tiny pulsings the blood flowed, reddening her
light-colored riding-habit, and spattering the costly fabric
of the ponchos.
</p>

<p>
The Captain bound his handkerchief tightly around
her arm midway between wrist and elbow.  The bleeding
ceased.
</p>

<p>
"Señors, who among you has a flask of aguardiente?"
</p>

<p>
Several were offered.
</p>

<p>
"Will one of the ladies bathe her face and forehead
with the liquor?"
</p>

<p>
Señora Higuera did the service.
</p>

<p>
Morando was tightly bandaging the injured member
with strips torn from handkerchiefs when the
patient opened her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My arm feels asleep, Don Alfredo," she murmured.
"Where am I?"
</p>

<p>
"With your friends, and safe," replied Morando.
</p>

<p>
Color gradually came into her face and lips.  Her
breath no longer fluttered.
</p>

<p>
"O, the poor little fellow so wanted to save his life
that I couldn't see him lose it," she murmured.  "The
hawk passed blow for blow with me.  His talon pricked
through my glove."
</p>

<p>
Word of the mishap had gone to Señor and Señora
Barcelo, who were riding in the vanguard of the
procession.  The complaining of the Barcelo carreta
mingled with the puffing of the Colonel's horse as the
two raced back.
</p>

<p>
"O, Silvia!  Silvia!  What dreadful thing has
happened?" wailed Señora Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened is over, sister mine.  Thanks
to our friends here, and Captain Morando in particular,
I am nothing the worse."
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless!  Doubtless!  How clumsy your arm looks
tied up that way!  Well, a peon reported you stricken
down by an attacking eagle.  How about it?" inquired
Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino quickly detailed the story.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  A pretty state of affairs!  Come, shall
we be going?  Matters of great importance wait my
arrival at the capitol."
</p>

<p>
"There is no reason to wait.  I am able to travel.
Amigos, adelante!" playfully waving her hand toward
the south.
</p>

<p>
Riders and carretas set out, Señora Valentino moving
slowly, the soldier by her side.  The Colonel, making
sure all was well with his sister-in-law, insisted on
traveling at full speed.  His wife's carreta plunged and
squeaked and rolled after him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," called Señora Higuera, in a little while,
"you are growing pale again.  Stay with us at Aguas
Calientes until you feel stronger.  We'll send a peon
messenger on a swift horse, to reach your sister with
explanations.  Come, Señora Valentino, we are at the
turn of the road."
</p>

<p>
"I fear, señora, your arm is swelling.  It will be better
to dismount at the Higuera hacienda house and have
the wound carefully bathed in warm water," counseled
Morando.
</p>

<p>
The house of the Higueras was but a few hundred
paces from the road, but Señora Valentino was able to
negotiate the distance only with greatest difficulty.
</p>

<p>
The señora's wrist had swelled considerably.  Morando
removed a small portion of the riding-glove
driven in by the bird's claw.  Good wife Higuera bathed
the wound in warm water, after which a soothing
lotion of herbs diminished the pain greatly.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Señora Valentino, rising from the couch
whither Morando had carried her, "it is time for me to
be going."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible, my lady," remonstrated Higuera.  "My
house and all in it are at your disposal.  Rest to-day.
Last night was a gay one, but a merry night means a
weary morning.  To-morrow, or the day after, you can
continue your way.  A proper guard will attend you.
Besides, your arm may require further treatment.  We
have an Indian woman on the hacienda who is only less
skillful than the Captain," bowing to Morando.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, amigos.  My sister rests at the Calderon
hacienda, near San José pueblo.  I can easily reach
there in an hour.  The scratch on my arm is nothing.
I am ashamed of having shown weakness over it.
Misericordia! am I sugar that I melt if a cupful of water
reaches me?"
</p>

<p>
Despite all protestations she insisted on starting
forth.
</p>

<p>
"Take a carreta, my dear heart," urged Señora
Higuera.  "Come, we'll fill the body of the vehicle with
blankets and have all as soft as down for you.  What
differs an hour more or less in the journey if you can
be more comfortable?  Let me make ready for you."
</p>

<p>
The señora would not listen to it.  She mounted her
horse gracefully, despite her bandaged arm, waved
adios to the Higueras, and set out toward San José
attended by Captain Morando.
</p>

<p>
"Be sure to stop if you feel weak," called Señora
Higuera.  "A peon will make his house yours, as well
will any ranchero."
</p>

<p>
"Never fear, good friends; I have strength and to
spare for the journey."
</p>

<p>
The rest of the merrymakers were well ahead.  The
señora and the Captain rode alone over a virgin
meadow.  Mountain and valley smiled.  The sun, giving
promise of a perfect day, crystallized his light in
myriad dewdrops hanging on flower petal and grass leaf.
The morning breeze carried the sweet voices of the hill
blooms as they sang in fragrance.  Mingled with it was
the pungent tang of wild mustard bursting into gold.
Great stretches of wild oats eddied and billowed away,
an emerald sea meeting the outposts of the coast range;
or, dropping across the valley, lost itself in the misty,
opalescent sky line.  High aloft the lark was warbling
his joy of living.  The blackbird in the meadows trilled
love songs to his mate.
</p>

<p>
The man and woman turned their horses and looked
along the way they had come.  The San Francisco Bay
reached in silvery arc to the horizon.  The great white
buildings of the Mendoza hacienda, stippled with the
gray of peon dwellings, rested against the hills.  Stray
cattle and horses made their way body-deep in the
luxuriant grass-growth, while the mountains echoed the
bleating of the Mission's sheep.  It was a picture of
pastoral California, rich and splendid.
</p>

<p>
The lady showed no trace of her accident of an hour
before.  Color was in her face and animation in her
tones as she said: "Captain Morando, let us look our
fill on this scene.  The future will see a panorama here
less wild, less beautiful, perhaps, but of greater
usefulness."  She turned her horse again southward.
</p>

<p>
Morando rode by her side, not speaking for several
moments.  Finally: "Señora, you have deep interest in
these Californias."
</p>

<p>
"You have said it, señor Captain.  I have, indeed, a
deep interest in the province."  As he said nothing she
continued: "I have a kindred interest in the 'province
of hearts' here also&mdash;to quote our host."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Captain, it would not surprise me if Señor
Mendoza's ball brought about half a dozen weddings.
The setting for love-making was exquisite.  It might
have been fashioned after some fairy scene, so delicately
were light and color blended, with that delicious music
of the natives permeating it all.  Madrid would have
gone wild over it!  Even the most watchful mamma and
dueña felt the spell and laughed and looked away while
some fair one allowed the brave Don Juan to hold her
hand and murmur nothings to her.  Why, even
señoritas and young sparks betrothed in childhood by
their parents yielded to the passion divine, as if their
love was at first sight."  She laughed gently.
</p>

<p>
"Was it so?  I am too little acquainted with the
families of Alta California to know of the young men
and women so engaged."
</p>

<p>
The señora's laugh was now merry, as she replied:
"I sit much with the old wives and know all the gossip.
I can tell you all about it.  There are Patricio Martinez
and Alfredo Castro.  Their families intermarried in
Spain before the new world was thought of, continued
in intermarriage in Mexico, and will not desist in
California.  Then, there are Lucinda Higuera and Aviel
Soto; Lolita Hernandez and young Julius Belden&mdash;part
gringo he is, as they term it here&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;yes,
Tula Rosa and Pancho Laynez."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there is the history of a family tree
connected with each of these betrothals!"
</p>

<p>
"There surely is.  I actually ache down to the tips
of my fingers," holding up her injured hand, "trying to
remember it all.  But come," checking her horse sharply,
in sudden remembrance, "there was one account most
interesting, or, rather, more interesting, even, than
others.  Who was it that told me?  I think, Señora
Valdez, or, perhaps, Señora Sanchez.  No, it must have
been the very aged Señora Hernandez, Don Marcel's
mother."
</p>

<p>
"My interest is aroused almost beyond bounds," he
laughed.
</p>

<p>
She returned the laugh.  "Well, whoever it was that
told me, I remember the story.  It relates to our host of
last night, Señor Mendoza, and Señor Peralta, father
of that splendid young cavalier, Don Abelardo."
</p>

<p>
The soldier's interest was now aroused in earnest.
</p>

<p>
"The friendship of Mendoza and of the Señor Peralta,
so the story goes, had beginning in old times.  Both were
soldiers, daring and efficient, and a common cause, that
of freeing Spain from French dominance, led to mutual
liking.  They campaigned together for years.
</p>

<p>
"A few hours' journey from Madrid, near Talavera
city, is a long bluff which Colonel Mendoza held, with
English troops, against the fury of Joseph Bonaparte's
veterans.  It was the pivotal center of the Iron Duke's
position&mdash;of course, this Iron Duke was just Sir Arthur
Wellesley then.  This much is history."
</p>

<p>
"I have read of Señor Mendoza's notable part in that
great battle."
</p>

<p>
"Well, in the charge, the second day, when the French
line was breaking, Mendoza's horse was shot and it fell,
pinning him beneath.  Peralta saved him from death at
the hands of a Toulousan lancer.  The Colonel mounted
another horse, nothing the worse for his experience.
Twice before nightfall did he again owe his life to his
friend Peralta.  This, according to my informant."
</p>

<p>
Morando said nothing.  The lady continued:
</p>

<p>
"Administrator Mendoza was instrumental in having
a grant of land made to Señor Peralta, who came here
to occupy it.  He married and had a son, Abelardo.
Later, the Administrator married, and his daughter
Carmelita came to bless his home."
</p>

<p>
Morando was looking intently at the speaker.
</p>

<p>
"One night the renegades from the eastern valleys
drove away many horses and cattle after maltreating
the attending peons.  Mendoza and Peralta, with their
fighting Indians, pursued the fleeing miscreants.  An
arrow pierced Peralta's body, and he would have fallen
to the ground had not Mendoza caught him.  Under
the protection of a branching oak, on the primeval
hillside, the end came.  The dying man's head lay on
Mendoza's lap, their hands clasped together, while
the sturdy Mendoza was weeping.  Peralta spoke
faintly:
</p>

<p>
"'The soldier dies from a savage's arrow, after years
of service on the field.  Well, mio amigo, be a friend to
my wife and boy.'
</p>

<p>
"'You have my word of honor,' replied Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Peralta continued: 'And&mdash;and&mdash;yes.  My senses
are leaving me.  I must speak quickly.  Let our
lifetime of friendship live after us, in the union of our
children when they are grown.'
</p>

<p>
"There, in the shade of nature, the greater shadow
of death hovering near, was the betrothal agreement
made.  The Indian riflemen stood around, sombreros
in hand, their weapons lying on the turf, to do homage
to death, the final conqueror.  Señor Mendoza still held
in his arms the clay of his friend, still his tears were
falling.  'The Peralta and Mendoza friendship shall
live on in our children,' he said in broken voice.  'The
living and the dead make this consecration.'"
</p>

<p>
Morando's horse reared to perpendicular line.
Unconsciously the Captain had gripped him with the spurs.
The animal sprang from the beaten road through dense
masses of underbrush, to the grassy field beyond.  It
required several minutes before Morando could bring
the creature back to the señora's side.  It still champed
the bit, while its eyes flashed from the sting of the
insult.
</p>

<p>
"Your horse is restive, señor soldier.  Perhaps we
have loitered along the way.  Come, we can reach the
Calderon home before the sun is warm."
</p>

<p>
They cantered in silence for a while.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go slowly for a few minutes," she said.  "I
find I am not so strong as I thought."
</p>

<p>
Paleness was again creeping into her face.
</p>

<p>
Morando quickly led her horse by the bridle to the
door of a peon's cot near the wayside, and assisted her
to dismount.  The Indian wife came curtsying out,
full of welcome.
</p>

<p>
"My house is yours," she insisted, bowing again and
again.  "Your visit will be long remembered.  I am
sorry my man is away and cannot help to receive you."
</p>

<p>
"Some warm water in a basin," said the soldier.  "The
señora has had an accident to her arm and it needs
attention."
</p>

<p>
Morando unbandaged the arm, bathed it in tepid
water, and rebandaged it more loosely.
</p>

<p>
The house was a one-room building, made of adobe,
whitewashed outside and inside, with a red tile roof.
The floor was earthen.  A half dozen children tumbled
about.  The Indian woman sat on a rude settee and
looked interestedly at the two occupying a similar piece
of furniture.
</p>

<p>
"My man is absent in San Joaquin," she said.  "He
is a vaquero for Señor Higuera.  We expect the cattle
soon to return, and again I will have my husband."
</p>

<p>
The señora was charmed with the naïveté of the
native.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you will be happy then," she said.  Color
had returned to her cheeks and brightness to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Great people need never be separated," the peona
went on.  "Now," speaking directly to Señora Valentino,
"you had your husband with you when sickness
met you, and he drove it away.  For me, two, three,
moons," counting on her fingers, "I have fought it alone
for myself and my pocos niños," pointing to her
brood.
</p>

<p>
The señora smiled.  "This señor is not my husband."
</p>

<p>
The woman looked intently at them.  "The spirits of
the future speak little here since Padre Lusciano came.
He drives them away with the breath of his mouth.
Dared they speak&mdash;dared they speak"&mdash;she laughed
quizzically&mdash;"they would say&mdash;they would say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke off and motioned to the third finger of the
señora's left hand, and simulated placing a ring thereon.
She turned to Morando and laughed again.
</p>

<p>
The señora arose to her feet.  "Come, Capitan, let
us thank the peona for her kindness and for her
suggestion of prophecy, and go on our journey.  I trust
my strength will not fail again."
</p>

<p>
Morando offered money to the woman, but she would
not accept it.
</p>

<p>
"The gold is for the ring," she replied with another
queer laugh.  "Why should I withhold kindnesses?"
she asked.  "God gives them to me.  I should not keep
them selfishly."
</p>

<p>
They thanked her for her good offices and went their
way.
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino was her buoyant self once more,
while Morando, though all courtesy and attention,
seemed in a quiet mood.
</p>

<p>
"Come, soldier mine," she suggested, "let us rejoice
with the landscape and sing with the spring."  She
waited, then laughed gayly.  "Perhaps the spirits of
the future gave you an unhappy horoscope."  Again
she gave way to merriment.
</p>

<p>
His answering laugh had a forced note, as he said:
"What a pity the spirits are no longer free to speak
without hindrance!  In so far, my lady, as the peona
spoke for them their message flattered me."  He doffed
his cap sweepingly.
</p>

<p>
"Gallant soldier!  But I was speaking a while ago
of this province of California.  Do you realize, Captain,
that here is a country exceeding Spain in area and
equaling her soil in fertility?"
</p>

<p>
"I do realize it, indeed, señora.  What we see here,"
indicating the waving valley, "and even after a winter
of drought, is a demonstration of most wonderful
fertility."
</p>

<p>
"Under the English flag all old customs will flourish
here; the civilization developed will be along Spanish
lines.  Colonists will come in numbers and a mighty
principality will grow&mdash;still it will be, in essentials,
Spanish.  A viceroy will be in power, combining the
office of a general with that of governor.  These vast
haciendas will be fruitful farms supporting more
hundreds than they do individuals now."
</p>

<p>
"What you say, señora, is not impossible."
</p>

<p>
"What power, what patronage, what opportunity
would belong to such a viceroy!  It would be well-nigh
that of a king."
</p>

<p>
Her companion made no response.
</p>

<p>
"My good soldier, of all the men in California who
do you think would be chosen to this high office of civil
and military leader?"
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza I believe to be the ablest man in
the province.  After him, I would say, comes Carillo,
in the South."
</p>

<p>
She smiled into his face.
</p>

<p>
"The first governor under English rule here will be
chosen on recommendation of three people.  I am one
of those three."
</p>

<p>
"What can you mean, Señora Valentino?" asked the
amazed man.
</p>

<p>
"I mean this.  It is my belief that English governing
will be the one most acceptable to the Californians.  I
have become Great Britain's special representative, and
I am laboring to bring about a judicious consummation."
</p>

<p>
The soldier looked wonderingly at her.  "Your
words, señora, while surprising me, explain many
things."
</p>

<p>
She went on: "When the British admiral opens in
Monterey harbor his sealed advices, he will find a paper
appointing as commander of the army and head of this
province the man on whom the English consul, Captain
Farquharson, and your humble servant have agreed as
the right one for that office."
</p>

<p>
She paused in her remarks, as if expecting him to
speak.  He did not.  She went on: "We have already
made our choice."  She spoke dispassionately.  "Now,
who do you think it is?"
</p>

<p>
"I can still form no idea, unless it be, indeed,
Mendoza, or Carillo&mdash;or, possibly, one of the Picos."
</p>

<p>
"It is none other than Capitan Alfredo Morando."
</p>

<p>
He checked his horse.
</p>

<p>
She swung her mount to meet him.  Neither spoke
for several moments.
</p>

<p>
He bared his head.  "Señora Valentino, words fail
me to express my gratitude for your high opinion of
me.  I thank you most cordially and most humbly."
</p>

<p>
They rode on in silence.
</p>

<p>
At last they neared the Calderon hacienda house.
</p>

<p>
"Before long we salute you as 'Your Excellency.'"
</p>

<p>
"No, señora.  As greatly as I prize the honor paid
me by you and the other two I shall leave California
forever, as soon as I can do so in fairness to my work."
</p>

<p>
The Calderons were hastening out to meet them.  The
anxious friends surrounded the señora.  Inquiring and
welcoming, they bore her away.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br />
O'DONNELL TAKES A HORSEBACK RIDE
</h3>

<p>
"Good pluck has that Indian lad of yours, Señor
Mendoza.  He faced the muzzles of the guns this
morning without batting an eye."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza and O'Donnell were in the Administrator's
office.  Mendoza's eye was alert, his eagle face keen.
The poncho thrown carelessly over his shoulders, his
mustachios and imperial made him look the Old World
soldier leader.
</p>

<p>
"My messenger evidently caught you before you
broke camp."  Mendoza spoke in English, as had the
other.
</p>

<p>
"By my faith! he burst into camp on that sorrel like
a meteor.  I had 'Adelante!' half out of my mouth
when he spurred on us.  A dozen pistols were aimed at
him, and why my fellows didn't shoot I don't see, except
that they were afraid of hitting the horse.  A native
more or less wouldn't count, but these scoundrels know
rare horseflesh night or day.  Perhaps they'd peeked
through the bars of your corrals, señor, when the peon
riflemen weren't looking."
</p>

<p>
The frontiersman laughed.  He lay back in his chair,
crossing his legs, and waited for the other to speak.
His beard and hair were free from the cords and were
flowing over his breast and shoulders.  The bearskin
leggings seemed more shaggy than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Those men will be your companions for a thousand
miles?"
</p>

<p>
"I can expect no other, Señor Mendoza.  Besides,
they serve me well."
</p>

<p>
"Señor O'Donnell, you represent great interests in
California."
</p>

<p>
"On another occasion I showed you documents which
assert that."
</p>

<p>
"Very true.  Now, at a critical time you lose yourself
in the wilderness, with no guard save a company of
cutthroats who would take a man's life for a handful of
pesos."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mendoza, what you say is so.  This is a critical
time and my men would hardly ornament a Sunday
school.  But I shall meet a representative of the United
States somewhere to the east of here, a thousand miles
more or less, receive instructions from Washington, and
send back my reports.  I go through safely; another
might not; so I am my own messenger.  In the passing
of three new moons, as the Indian counts, I shall again
be in the Valley of Santa Clara."
</p>

<p>
The big man laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"You go through safely, you say.  Are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely.  My dare-devils respect the man who
is not afraid of them.  Besides, I travel a country the
chiefs of which are sworn Indian brothers to me."
</p>

<p>
"And you trust them&mdash;these wild Indians of the
mountains?"
</p>

<p>
"Again I say, absolutely."
</p>

<p>
"I hope your faith is not misplaced."
</p>

<p>
"It is not.  Mendoza, I have been for ten years among
these fierce tribes.  From them I learned the moods of
the desert and the paths that conquer the mountains.
Their tents were mine, and they shared their food with
me.  I came to know the Indian heart, and was willing
to become blood brother with their chiefs.  Yes, I trust
them absolutely."
</p>

<p>
"Blood brother?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a covenant of friendship.  I am as sure it will
not be broken as I am that Kit Carson will keep word
and meet me beyond the high mountains a month hence."
</p>

<p>
"But this covenant of friendship&mdash;this becoming a
blood brother&mdash;how did you manage it?"
</p>

<p>
"By transfusion of blood from their veins to mine.
The medicine men are surgeons&mdash;of a kind; the arm
veins supply the blood."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza looked closely at the frontiersman.  "You
are, then, an Indian leader."
</p>

<p>
"I have the long hair of a chief, as you see.  I allow
my beard to grow, also, which the natives cannot do, to
show I am a chief of chiefs."
</p>

<p>
"A chief of chiefs!  What of Yoscolo?  Is he included
in this unique brotherhood?"
</p>

<p>
"No; decidedly no.  Yoscolo disdains Indian virtues,
replacing them by white men's wickedness."
</p>

<p>
"Will you be safe from him on this journey?"
</p>

<p>
"My friends would harry him out of the Sierras, and
down to these valleys where he would meet destruction
at the hands of your riflemen."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, friend O'Donnell.  But I am keeping
you too long.  I will come to the point now.  I detained
you from an early start on that long road of yours for
an important matter.  The English have been very active
in creating a sentiment here favorable to annexing
our province to Great Britain."
</p>

<p>
"There are many signs of their activity; but others
have been active too."
</p>

<p>
"It is time your government should survey roads
between California and your westernmost outpost."
</p>

<p>
The large man sprang to his feet.  "Capital, Mendoza!
Capital, sir!  It's good to hear you say that.  I
didn't expect it so soon.  Will you put it down in
writing, and sign your name to it?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly.  I will also do my part toward welcoming
settlers from your republic when the roads are
built."
</p>

<p>
"Famous!  Famous!  That is exactly what I wanted
you to say every time we've met.  It's worth the
hindrance in my journey to hear news like that."  Then,
suddenly, "Something special has happened to bring
you to this conclusion.  What is it?  I've been debating
for weeks with you, and with no apparent result."
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell seated himself.  A peon had come in
response to a signal from Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Aguardiente and cigarros," the master ordered.
</p>

<p>
"I can talk better when smoking," offering the other
a light.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I listen better."
</p>

<p>
They smoked for a little while without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"You know, personally, Farquharson, England's
special representative here, if I remember rightly,"
Mendoza breaking the silence, his eyes intently studying
his guest.
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen him for many years, but I once
knew him well enough.  He has been as busy as a bee
for several months."
</p>

<p>
"Very true; but the other British agent, Señora
Valentino, is still more active&mdash;of course you know all
about it.  By the way, was Yoscolo alone in the
abduction of Farquharson a day or two ago in Monterey?
Can you tell me?  You know he was abducted, of
course."
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell gave a roar of laughter, and smoked vigorously.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me I did hear something of it.  In fact,
for a while everybody was inquiring for this lost
Englishman.  I ran into his servant who was ranging
Monterey and shouting for his 'Cap'n.'  I believe he found
him too."
</p>

<p>
"It seemed to me that it was a little beyond even
Yoscolo's talents to play such a game in Monterey city
unless some white man had encouraged him."
</p>

<p>
The big man was greatly amused.  "To tell the truth,
Señor Mendoza, it was I who was in a measure back
of that game."
</p>

<p>
"I thought as much."
</p>

<p>
"You see Farquharson came across the Indian several
months ago, and played for his good offices.  Not a bad
idea, for a power of renegades followed him.  All of
Yoscolo's Indians were to declare for English
sovereignty&mdash;much they know what it is.  Yoscolo wanted
money&mdash;the clever rascal.  He made the capture as near
Farquharson's banker as possible&mdash;a suggestion of
mine.  I figured that Farquharson deserved to lose his
money for his attempt at bribery.  But the Englishman
slipped the toils.  I heard Yoscolo nearly had a fit
when the news reached him."
</p>

<p>
"You do not like Farquharson personally?"
</p>

<p>
A gust of anger came over O'Donnell's face.  "No!
No!  The Englishman is my enemy for something that
occurred years ago in old Ireland."
</p>

<p>
"I too knew Farquharson many, many years ago.  I
have not seen him in late times.  I blamed him once for
an act that reflected on his judgment.  Later he greatly
distinguished himself at Waterloo.  I am surprised that
he would stoop to bribery.  In fact, the manner of
procedure of the English agents here has not disposed me
to their cause."
</p>

<p>
"So much the worse for England, and so much the
better for the United States," O'Donnell commented.
</p>

<p>
"Good friend O'Donnell, I favor the United States
in the present matter because they reach two thirds
across the continent to us already; because their
government appeals to me; and, last but not least, because
their agent, Señor O'Donnell, is not attempting to rush
our people like sheep into the American fold."
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers for you, Señor Mendoza!  Speak these
words from the housetops.  Your patriotism will soon
equal my own.  The Irish and the Spanish are always of
one heart anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Some time ago I told you that if I played in this
political game, I'd use the trump that meant the most
to the province of California.  I am far from
forwarding my own interest in thus doing."  He went to a
secretary and took therefrom a bulky envelope.  Opening it
he handed to O'Donnell several papers, one of which
read:
</p>

<p>
"On recommendation of the Duke of Wellington,
Jesus Maria y José Mendoza, of Mission San José,
California, is tendered the office of major-general in the
army of Great Britain," and mentioning in highest
encomium Mendoza's masterful service from Talavera
to the fall of Toulouse which crushed Napoleon, and
sent him to Elba.  The document was signed and sealed
by high officials of the kingdom.
</p>

<p>
The other papers were personal letters from Wellington,
the dates of which ran through many years, urging
Mendoza to accept promotion and offering to advance
him in every way should he come to England.
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell scanned the Administrator critically.  "Yet
you remained with this province?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I cast my lot with California, and with her
I shall live.  An English protectorate would, without
doubt, be more to my own personal advantage; however,
I favor American rule here."
</p>

<p>
"But, Señor Mendoza, how about your neighbors,
north and south?"  All at once the Irishman sat erect,
suddenly realizing the full meaning of the words he had
read.  "A major-general in the British army!"  He
looked admiringly at Mendoza.  "At my best I was but
a grenadier-sergeant."
</p>

<p>
"Friend O'Donnell, my neighbors, north and south,
are playing 'Follow the leader' in no small way.  Señora
Valentino, sister-in-law of our acting-governor, Barcelo,
is the leader.  She has cleverly brought them to the
mountain top, and down the side they must go, by their
own impetus&mdash;unless, O'Donnell, we hold them back."
</p>

<p>
"I know of this señora.  Young Peralta raves over
her.  Carillo sings of her cleverness and beauty.  The
ladies vow she is a breath of old Madrid come to
enliven the air of far-away provincial California."
</p>

<p>
"The señora is a very clever and a very beautiful
woman," added Mendoza.  "In Mexico I heard that she
was coming here.  She is famous on three continents as
a most successful diplomatist.  I can well believe she
deserves the reputation."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure of it&mdash;more than sure of it."
</p>

<p>
"Last night in my house my friends declared for the
English flag.  I advised consideration.  She adroitly
opposed.  Her wishes carried.  An attempt will be made
to have the English government take possession at once.
We must forestall them, O'Donnell."
</p>

<p>
"By my faith!  By my faith! we must!"
</p>

<p>
"I love California too much to see her tossed
precipitously into any hands, be it English or American."
</p>

<p>
The Irishman stormed back and forth over the floor.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza continued: "I have a plan, but the carrying
it out would delay for some time your journey
across the mountains."
</p>

<p>
"Carson awaits my coming, if I delay a month.  What
is your plan?"
</p>

<p>
"To find just where the American fleet is; catch the
attention of your commodore; then call him for
consultation with some of us here who have not been swept
off our feet by the clever Señora Valentino."
</p>

<p>
"Three days ago the fleet stood into the scimitar-shaped
bay west of here, Commodore Billings in command.
He had sighted the British fleet off Callao,
Peru, and scudded ahead of them."
</p>

<p>
"Bueno!  Bueno!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll get in touch with Billings as soon as I can."
</p>

<p>
"Let him run his ships till he can anchor off some
spot nearest San José Mission."
</p>

<p>
"The sooner I see the Commodore the better.  Will
you send a messenger to my camp telling my braves to
wait there till further orders?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now to the saddle.  I set out on horseback to
overtake an ocean-going fleet.  Ha! ha! ha!" the
Irishman's wit coming to the fore.
</p>

<p>
"At least not till after breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"I've breakfasted already; thank you, señor.  Adios!"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute.  Tell me, have you been instrumental
in keeping Yoscolo from molesting our herds and
our servants in the San Joaquin?  It must be some
unusual influence, that has held him quiet this long."
</p>

<p>
"I've threatened him with a trouncing from the
strong tribes in the interior if he continues his
deviltries.  He met our chiefs in a great powwow in the
Sierras and spoke of peace to them, in the voice of
a cooing dove.  They do not trust him; neither do I.
I'll deliver the thrashing if he breaks his word."
</p>

<p>
"I greatly regret, Señor O'Donnell, that our
California valleys did not know you years ago."
</p>

<p>
"The regret is mutual."
</p>

<p>
They passed out to the courtyard gate.
</p>

<p>
The house guests were returning from cool dips in
the swimming ponds, according to custom; then
breakfast; then rest.
</p>

<p>
"Who is the stranger with our host?" one dueña
asked of another.
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless some trader in tallow."
</p>

<p>
"Even the early morning after the baile leaves not the
señor free from their intrusion."
</p>

<p>
The men parted.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br />
SEÑORA VALENTINO MAKES A REPORT
</h3>

<p>
"Cap', if I do admit it, I never saw such a place
as this for growin' things.  Look at that grass.
The finest hay in America could be cut there in way
less than a month.  Good oat, too, every spear of it.
Reckon 'twill pretty much go to waste.  Durn shame
it is.  Wish I had a hundred of them acres back in old
Missouri.  Whew!"
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning Brown and his employer had
ridden down the hills skirting the eastern rim of Santa
Clara valley, and were laboriously making their way
through the luxuriant growths of that fertile section.
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure these acres will not be as valuable one
day where they are as they would be in your native
section," returned Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"Put in your wheat, rye or barley here," continued
Brown; "raise your crop.  Then where be ye?  Nobody
round to buy you up and pay you money.  We're too
durn fur away here, Cap', for the country to be
more'n bird ranges&mdash;yes, bird ranges, where the blessed
little fellers can warble and chatter from daylight to
their bedtime."
</p>

<p>
"Brown, what would you think if I predict that in a
short time colonists will come here, men understanding
farming and tree culture, to make this Western country
their home?"
</p>

<p>
Brown shook his head.  "If they double our tracks,
Cap' from Santa Fé here, they'll need their fairy
boots.  Mighty rough trail we followed, and it's no
smoother yet, I reckon.  Besides, there's a sight of
country between Santa Fé and civilization east of there
which must be traveled some way.  No, Cap', white
men will shy this land for many a day, to my thinking.
Durn sorry, too.  Wish it wasn't so blame far from
everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"But men can come here by water," suggested Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"That depends where they start from.  Quite a
journey to here by water from Saint Louis, Missouri."
</p>

<p>
"No farther than England is from California.
Brown, it would not surprise me if, before many years,
shiploads of people from England will be tilling farms
right here in this Santa Clara valley."
</p>

<p>
They were coming into the grounds of the Calderon
hacienda.  The white buildings gleamed in the morning
light.  The rolling hills formed a green background.
Peons were going forth to the fields, at work in the
gardens, or busy about their adobe cottages which
nestled near the home of their master.
</p>

<p>
"Stay by the horses, Brown, while I enter," said
Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"Just as you say, Cap'."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman sought the entrance of the mansion
and inquired for Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"The señora met with an accident this morning,"
said one of the Señoritas Calderon who met him.  "She
is resting.  Last night there was a baile at Señor
Mendoza's, in Mission San José.  She was there and has
slept almost none till the present."
</p>

<p>
"Was the accident serious?" solicitude in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Not serious, but painful."
</p>

<p>
"If you announce that Captain Farquharson would
like words with her, I am sure she will not feel herself
disturbed.  It is really of great importance that I see
her."
</p>

<p>
"What is it, querida?" asked Señora Calderon,
coming to the outer hall.
</p>

<p>
"A señor caller to see Señora Valentino, mamita."
</p>

<p>
"She is nearly dropping for sleep, señor, as are we
all.  Besides, her hand is wounded."
</p>

<p>
"I saw your horse, Captain Farquharson, from my
window, between winks.  I had thought to catch an
hour's sleep before you came.  I am glad you are so
prompt, though."  Señora Valentino stood in the
doorway.  Then to Señora Calderon and her daughter, she
said, "Friends, I made an engagement to speak with
the señor caballero this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, señora.  Pardon, señor," from the
Calderons together.  "We leave you."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" from Farquharson, when the others were gone.
</p>

<p>
"You have said it," Señora Valentino replied.  "It
is well."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it."
</p>

<p>
"In the first place, the Friar Lusciano Osuna has
decided for active service."
</p>

<p>
"Good news, señora."
</p>

<p>
"The power of his words is overwhelming.  He will
be most valuable in winning Baja California to our
cause.  He came to see that English rule would be a
fostering one to his Indian wards.  On no other ground
would he take part with us."
</p>

<p>
"But why do we need his work in Baja California
more than in Alta California?"
</p>

<p>
"Good señor, this part of the province has been
carefully worked over, and is responsive.  In comparison,
the lower half has scarcely been touched.  I have made
some representations touching sentiment there which
may need bolstering."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Last night, at the baile, the young men, the most
of them, were rapturously in favor of the English
protectorate."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson smiled.
</p>

<p>
"The elders ardently followed; that is, the majority.
A few hard-headed ones were obdurate.  Mendoza, as
I expected, was as set as a sheet anchor."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, señora."
</p>

<p>
"The greater number had arrived at that acute
moment of mental tenseness when some outward act
becomes a positive necessity.  The dynamic, while thus
agitating them, had set their consciousness in direction
of an English protectorate.  They became enthusiastic,
perfervid, deadly determined on that protectorate.
</p>

<p>
"Then Mendoza voiced his desire of further
consideration.  So strongly did his personality affect the
company that they were wavering, though still they
shouted for England.  Mendoza's very will was swaying
them.  The moment of our success was passing.  Once
let it slip, and all the king's horses could not bring it
back to power again."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Then I used a letter which Señor Carillo recently
sent me&mdash;not reading it, but interpreting into its
contents a meaning which might be fairly given, though I
think it overtranslated the writer's position.  The
smoldering enthusiasm of our señors blazed again.
</p>

<p>
"Still Mendoza held them.  I began to fear that
nothing would come of the meeting which had begun so
auspiciously."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson was very intent.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you remember, Captain, reading in your
school days from that old Latin lesson book, 'Viri
Romæ,' how the cackling of geese saved Rome?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly," laughed Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a game of cards saved us last night.  My
brother-in-law had suffered defeat at cribbage, and
consequently was piqued.  I had, some time ago,
broached him on the subject of our work here, and he
was not favorable.  So I said nothing more to him.
My brother-in-law rates most highly his proficiency at
cribbage, and takes it very hard if defeated.  The
very-evident hold of Mendoza on the land barons seemed to
increase his ill-humor, and straightway he,
acting-governor as he is, declared for England."
</p>

<p>
"Extraordinary, señora!  Most extraordinary!"
</p>

<p>
"His words threw the Californians into a frenzy.
They cast aside all restraint, and boldly declared for
an English protectorate.
</p>

<p>
"Young Peralta, with the Señors Hernandez and Valencia,
were appointed a committee to meet the British
representatives at Monterey, and to arrange for the
fleet to take possession of the capital.  I would rather
they had waited for this till we had brought Baja
California to the same conviction of mind that our friends
reached last night at Mendoza's; but I thought it wiser
not to oppose.  'Better a bird in the hand than two in
the bush,' Captain."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Now, I'm sure Padre Osuna can sway our southern
friends as he pleases, but the friar must have time.  If
this committee comes in communication with our
admiral now, and he takes over Monterey, Northern
California will applaud, but&mdash;Southern California may rise
in rebellion."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then, our admiral must not be found until we judge
the time is ready.  Keep him away from Monterey until
all sections will welcome his coming to raise the British
flag on Monterey castle."
</p>

<p>
"Of course our government expects us to do our part
before summoning Admiral Fairbanks to do his.  The
Admiral will not appear officially until that time."
</p>

<p>
"You have the idea, my Captain.  The committee
goes to Monterey, when it chooses; the fleet comes when
we choose."
</p>

<p>
"Will Mendoza and the others like-minded make any
counter move?  Could you determine anything as to
that?"
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing, possibly because they may have
nothing in mind to do.  I spoke both to Zelaya and to
Higuera.  I think, Captain, they are an army with guns
spiked.  Yet, we must not relax until California becomes
British territory."
</p>

<p>
"You say truly, señora.  Admiral Fairbanks's fleet
reached San Diego last week.  Shortly he will anchor
in the little bay north of Yerba Buena, where Francis
Drake is believed to have sojourned.  We will keep in
touch with Fairbanks, and his ships will take possession
of this province when the right moment comes; that is,
when the people call aloud for it."
</p>

<p>
"A wise captain!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, señora, what of Morando?  We have
thought it well to bring high office within his reach.
Now, what was his part in last night's victory?"
</p>

<p>
"He favors retaining the old ideals which Spain
presented to all the New World provinces that she has
settled."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; let them be retained.  But the present
and great question?  Did he stand by your side or
Mendoza's?"
</p>

<p>
The lady bit her lip.  "His steps found middle
ground."
</p>

<p>
"Zounds; lady!  Do you mean he is half-hearted?"
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you, señor.  He is a Spaniard who has left
the mother country for this wider field; nevertheless,
he is a Spaniard, and he can never become English."
</p>

<p>
"He is welcome to remain the Spaniard in sentiment.
Politically, however, he can be English.  Is he different
from the scores who last night declared for England?"
</p>

<p>
She did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"Does he look for a government different from the
one to which his California brethren enthusiastically
turn?"
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino colored.  "Captain Morando last
night promised me to stand by Castilian manhood and
womanhood.  Hand and glove he declared it.  Further
he did not go.  Try as I might he advanced nothing.
The ruling thought of the hour passed him by."
</p>

<p>
"You astonish me."
</p>

<p>
"He is as deeply in love with Carmelita Mendoza as
ever.  His feet press after her everywhere."  The
señora's own foot tapped the floor impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"For this reason he favors Mendoza's reactionary
tactics, you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I think his mind has never got very far beyond the
fair Carmelita herself."
</p>

<p>
"A young and handsome fellow, my señora, makes
love as easily as he talks.  About as easily is it
accepted&mdash;and forgotten."
</p>

<p>
"I do not think Morando's attitude toward the
Señorita Mendoza can thus be described."
</p>

<p>
"Quite possibly, señora, quite possibly.  Now, we had
determined&mdash;it was your suggestion, by the way&mdash;to
make this young man governor and commander here
when the time comes.  A splendid idea!  All California
will be proud of their handsome and brilliant leader.
Our English colonists, when they arrive, will admire the
soldier.  A future of great usefulness and power awaits
him.  Why not find occasion, as you know him well, to
tell him of these things, and make him one of us?"
</p>

<p>
"It is in vain."
</p>

<p>
"And why?"
</p>

<p>
"I did tell him.  We rode together from Mission San
José to this place."
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he contemplates soon leaving California
forever."
</p>

<p>
"Most unaccountable, señora, most unaccountable!
But&mdash;a man like Morando does not cast aside such
prospects of high honors and power unless some strong
counter attraction prompts him.  Well&mdash;if he leaves,
we must find someone to take his place."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson arose.  "I hope your hand will not
trouble you seriously.  When do you return to Monterey?"
</p>

<p>
"I remain a day or two with the Calderons, then I
go home."
</p>

<p>
"Allow me to congratulate you again on your success
of last night.  Directly I see Fairbanks I will send or
bring you word.  Good morning, señora.  My best
wishes to you."
</p>

<p>
The lady bade him farewell and watched him mount,
the voluble Brown declaring, "These roses have spread
out two inches while you've been gone, Cap'."
</p>

<p>
She waved another farewell, and turned again to the
reception room.  "I win provinces," she thought, "yet
I am alone, alone.  People crowd around me, yet am I
lonely.  I envy the peona we met this morning.  I envy
her the brood of pocos niños, her absent husband, and,
above all, God of my soul! her contentment.  If the
world were mine I would give it for that!"
</p>

<p>
She went slowly to her room and closed the door,
then turned to the mirror.  It showed the faultless face
and form of a beautiful woman.  "It is all to win
provinces!&mdash;nothing but&mdash;provinces."
</p>

<p>
She remained long in thought.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but provinces!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br />
THE SEÑORITA OF THE WINDOW PANE
</h3>

<p>
The fog lifted from Monterey Bay, for a few
fleeting moments hung in aerial battlements over land
and water, then dissolved in the alchemic sun-rays.  The
blue stretches of water laughed and sang on the beach.
Soft southern winds purred among the crags which
edged the ocean, rustled the tree branches, waved the
flowers, rested on the tiled roofs of the white city, and
fanned the calm-souled populace.
</p>

<p>
Another day had begun in the capital.
</p>

<p>
It was some minor feast day.  The bells of the church
on the town outskirts rang their call to service.  A
moment's silence.  In the distance a clear note sounded,
its limpid melody clinging in the air.  Another note,
and yet another, and another, until the breath of the
countryside was resonant.  It was the chimes of San
Carlos Carmelo, a league away.
</p>

<p>
A young officer rode slowly along El Camino Real
leading into Monterey from the north.  A dozen or
more mounted carbineers followed him.
</p>

<p>
Peon children stared curiously at the uniformed men,
and whispered among themselves of the great caballero
whose scabbard clinked against his silver-mounted
stirrup with each forward movement of the horse.
</p>

<p>
"Whither bound, Señor Capitan Morando?" called a
group of churchgoers.
</p>

<p>
"To the house of Colonel Barcelo."
</p>

<p>
"The Colonel and his señora are already in the
church," some one said.
</p>

<p>
The Captain bowed and smiled, but continued his
way.
</p>

<p>
He led his men to the square, then walked to the
Barcelo mansion.
</p>

<p>
Benito, the porter, guarded the entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Have my unworthy eyes the honor of beholding
Captain Morando, of San José?"
</p>

<p>
"I am Captain Morando, and I wish to see Señora
Valentino."
</p>

<p>
"I am honored to lead you within."  The man bowed
low.  "The señora is in the reception hall."
</p>

<p>
He conducted Morando to a large room opening
directly on the courtyard.  Wide doors lying ajar
invited the refreshing air to enter, as well the morning
sun.
</p>

<p>
"The Captain Morando," the porter announced.
</p>

<p>
"You are taking the sun, I see, señora."
</p>

<p>
"At my lazy ease, Captain.  Please be seated."
</p>

<p>
They chatted for a little on different topics, till she
said:
</p>

<p>
"Captain Morando, I spoke to you, the morning after
Mendoza's baile, of the combined civil and military
governorship of California when England comes.  I
sent for you to-day that I might talk this matter over
further with you."
</p>

<p>
"I am highly flattered to call on Señora Valentino.
A delightful woodland ride is followed by this more than
delightful meeting."  The young man placed his hand
on his breast and inclined gracefully to the lady.  She
acknowledged the compliment by a single movement of
the head.
</p>

<p>
"You do not forget that you have come this morning
along El Camino Real&mdash;the King's Highway?"
</p>

<p>
"It is fit, truly, to be the highway of a king."
</p>

<p>
"Our Captain is appreciative.  No?"
</p>

<p>
"In the past months I have followed it from San
Diego to Sonoma, and have seen something of the
magnificent framework of which this highway is the
vertebræ."
</p>

<p>
The lustrous brown eyes smiled at him.  "It has been
traveled by vice-regal governor and Mexican envoy.
This room received them.  On that dais," pointing to a
platform at the end of the apartment, "obeisance has
been paid from the noblest the land held."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! this, then, was the state reception room,"
looking about with interest.
</p>

<p>
"Those straight-backed chairs along the wall held
waiting grandees when California belonged to Spain;
and governors for this province were sent from the
homeland.  Privy councils were held here.  Agreements
of state were formulated and signed here.  Much of the
history of California was made in this place.  The
house, from being the governmental palace, passed, in
Mexican times, to private ownership."
</p>

<p>
"O, I see, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Captain, the old days must have been glorious, but,
after all, they were but seeds of more significant times.
The new governor will have vastly greater opportunity
than the others ever dreamed of."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot doubt it, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Then, my Captain, be the first English governor in
Monterey.  The office will be yours for the taking."
</p>

<p>
"You speak to me, señora, of high office endowed with
great power ready to my hand.  Mindful as I am of
your consideration, I could not, if I would, accept a
place for which I have had no training, and for which
I feel no aptitude."
</p>

<p>
"A modest captain!  Your words do you credit, my
soldier.  But, you have not yet looked on all sides of the
question.  You would be the front of the incoming
administration.  Back of you would stand men who have
had experience in applied statecraft, but who lack the
unusual qualifications you possess successfully to
represent English rule to the residents of this province."
</p>

<p>
"Still, señora, I would be occupying a position in
which I would be entirely inexperienced."
</p>

<p>
"But think, Captain; consider.  With time comes
the experience."
</p>

<p>
"Again I thank you, señora.  But, when I feel free
to do so I shall leave California and seek a career
elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
"California needs you.  Castilian ideals and
Castilian faith need you."
</p>

<p>
"I shall fail no duty, señora."
</p>

<p>
"But the governorship?" persistently.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, my friend, may I ask you to believe me
when I say I could not accept it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain, the formal offer, nevertheless, will
come to you in a short time."
</p>

<p>
She touched a bell.  Her maid entered.
</p>

<p>
"Atila, please bring us coffee and some of those
dulces for which Alfonsa, the cook, is so famous."
</p>

<p>
The girl soon reappeared with a small table covered
with a white cloth, and on which was dainty china ready
for the serving.  A pot of steaming coffee and a plate
of freshly made sweet cake were added.  A small vase
of purple violets furnished adornment.
</p>

<p>
Gentle breezes stole into the room, carrying with
them the nestling of the leaves in the patio and the
perfume of the growing things.
</p>

<p>
"What a land of enchantment you have at your very
side!" indicating the out-of-doors.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I fancy this to be a wishing-chair,"
indicating the one on which she was sitting.  "Then the
patio becomes unique.  I often sit by the hour, and
frame around it pictures of life as I would like to live
it.  That space outside is transformed into a jungle,
the birds, my brothers and sisters, while the riotous
colors embellish the leafy homes of the little people.
Sweet woodsy odors refresh me, and I repose in the
shady recesses, my heart singing the songs of
Utopialand."
</p>

<p>
"Most pleasing fancies, indeed, my señora."
</p>

<p>
"They are my refuge.  I lose myself in fancyland
to crowd out other and unhappy memories."  Her eyes
grew troubled.  Her face lost its curves of power.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Señora Valentino," began the soldier, his
chivalry touched, "your husband is gone from you,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her gesture stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"I anticipate your words, Captain.  It is not what I
have lost that makes me sad.  It is the absence of what
forms the warp and woof of a woman's life, the things
I have never had."
</p>

<p>
"What they can be I do not know, señora.  I cannot
imagine a life more filled than yours, except for the loss
of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Again her gesture left his sentence incomplete.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Morando, forgive me if I say such words
mock me."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, the world is at your feet.  The bravest and
the proudest court your smiles.  At that ball in Madrid
I saw our commander lead you to the king, and together
they bowed over your hand, while the multitude
applauded.  Can you not even now hear them?  'Viva!
Viva! the fairest and gentlest in the kingdom!  Viva!
Señora Valentino!'"
</p>

<p>
"Not that, Captain; not that," deprecatingly.
"Praise from the lips fills not the heart.  Five years
ago a prima donna thrilled all Europe.  King and
subject alike did her homage.  In Paris the noble were
honored by drawing her carriage to the opera house,
having detached the horses.  Yet last year she died
alone and heartbroken."
</p>

<p>
"But for you, my dear lady!"
</p>

<p>
"It almost overcomes me, Captain, when I look back
over my life.  I rarely have courage to do so."  She
knit her brows.
</p>

<p>
"You know Señora Barcelo is my half sister only?"
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"No, I did not."
</p>

<p>
"My father was an elderly man when he married my
mother.  His daughter, now Señora Barcelo, was then
nearly grown.  My mother died when I was three years
old, my father, a few months later.  I can scarcely
remember either.  My half sister married and went away.
I was placed in the convent of Maria del Pilar, in
Madrid."
</p>

<p>
"Maria del Pilar!"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I was in the division of the convent assigned to the
daughters of hidalgo worth.  I was reared there, on
the strictest monastic lines.  I was naturally
light-hearted.  Perhaps my grave teachers did not
understand me, for they fettered my spirit by restrictions
most onerous.  If they had only taken the little motherless
child to their arms and kissed away the loneliness!
</p>

<p>
"One day I was in punishment for some infraction of
discipline.  The penalty was to remain alone in the
dormitory, on the topmost floor of the building.  I
heard martial music in the square before the convent.
I knew that the cadets of San Sebastian military school
were drilling there."
</p>

<p>
"Why, señora, I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She continued.  "The windows were stained except
one pane, not a large one, which had been broken and
replaced by plain glass.  I climbed to it&mdash;the pane was
rather high&mdash;and witnessed the military maneuvers.  I
remember the captain of one company as well as if it
were yesterday, his youthful figure and trim uniform,
his sword against his shoulder, his intent face."
</p>

<p>
Morando was listening closely.
</p>

<p>
"Whenever I could I watched that cadet corps at its
evolutions on the plaza.  Often I stole away from study
to the dormitory.
</p>

<p>
"One day the captain saw me.  He waved his sword.
I tapped the glass.  That formed a code of signals."
</p>

<p>
The soldier smiled.
</p>

<p>
"The years went on.  I saw my young captain become
a colonel; saw his smooth lip darken with mustachios.
His eyes and sword flashed at me the first time he wore
the colonel's chevrons.
</p>

<p>
"A firm hand on my shoulder startled me one day.
'Step down, señorita,' came the voice of our prefectress
of discipline.  'Now let me see this great sight!'  My
colonel was waving his sword toward the window.  He
turned away when the new face came in view, but not
in time to prevent the sister prefectress seeing the
salutation.
</p>

<p>
"A council was called.  My teachers decided that a
very grave breach of discipline had been committed.
The prefectress, even with inspection from a nearer
window, could not designate the cadet who had waved
his sword.  'How long has this continued?' they
demanded.  I told them.  They were greatly shocked.
</p>

<p>
"I was ordered to point out the military student who
had been so indiscreet as to carry on flirtation with a
hidalgo's daughter in Pilar Convent.  I refused to do
so, nor could they overcome my will.  I feared for him.
The mother superior vowed she would have him 'broken.'  She
was the cardinal's sister, and all-powerful.
</p>

<p>
"My penalty soon came.  The head of my family, a
cousin, was called.  He took as grave view of my
conduct as had my teachers.  'A marriage must be
arranged for the imprudent girl at once.  A man of years
and firmness should be found.  This levity must yield
to correction,' he decided.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Valentino had been a widower for several
years.  He was my cousin's intimate friend.  The
wedding day was set before I even saw my future husband.
</p>

<p>
"I objected to the marriage, but the Spanish conventions
of our class are as unyielding as stone.  What
could I do, but finally consent?  At seventeen I found
myself married to a man old enough to be my father.
There was nothing in common between us.  He meant
to be kind.  He was just, as he was courageous and
able.  I accompanied him on diplomatic missions and
learned much, but knew no happiness.  Then he went to
Morocco, and death.  I am here to work in a cause I
believe to be right, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She bowed her head.  "If I gained the whole world
for England, it would not fill one empty cranny of my
heart."
</p>

<p>
Morando did not know what to say in response.
</p>

<p>
"I have never known a father's care, nor a mother's
love.  Add to this unhappy childhood.  Add again a
loveless and childless marriage, and you have my life."
</p>

<p>
"My dear señora!  My dear señora!"  His words
stopped.  He was standing before the lady, who also
arose, her eyes flashing, her tones vibrating.
</p>

<p>
"I was in Constantinople, Great Britain's agent,
when the news came of Colonel Valentino's death.  I
started at once for Spain.  A storm raged on the Sea
of Marmora.  I took the wedding ring from my finger
and threw it into the foam.  The roar of the tempest
and the shriek of the cordage was the requiem of that
marriage-symbol.  I wish I could bury the past and
its memories as deep as is buried that ring.  But
memories will not down," she went on passionately.  "Some
unquiet spirit possesses them.  They trouble my sleep
at night; they walk with me in the day.  And, O, my
Captain, the future!"  She closed her eyes with a little
shudder, as if to blot out unpleasant sights.
</p>

<p>
"My dear lady, you forget what you are in the lives
of others.  Even that embryo soldier, the cadet of San
Sebastian's, welcomed his colonelcy the more because
the girl-face in the little diamond pane would brighten
when she saw the uniform.  The inspiration to win
honors came in no small degree from that topmost spot
of grim old Pilar Convent."
</p>

<p>
He looked intently at her, his voice throbbing with
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"My señora, have you known&mdash;did you know&mdash;do
you not&mdash;&mdash;" His voice broke.
</p>

<p>
She said nothing, but her eyes searched his.
</p>

<p>
"O, señora&mdash;that night at the ball in Madrid&mdash;that
night when you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What, my Captain?"
</p>

<p>
His words came more steadily.
</p>

<p>
"When I saw you at General Guerrero's ball I was
beset by voices from the past calling to me, persistently
calling.  I was introduced to you.  The voices called
louder.  Still were they incoherent.  The evening grew.
I danced with you.  I could not fathom the meaning
of that call which sounded with increasing insistency.
The days passed.  I concluded that some wraith of
dreams had hovered over me.  At the merienda, when
again introduced to you, I did not, for the moment,
recognize the Señora Valentino of that military ball.
You reminded me of our previous meeting, which I
immediately recalled, the difference in your gown
explaining my lack of recognition.  As I talked with you the
past spoke again to me, and in language I could not
comprehend.
</p>

<p>
"O, señora, need I tell you that I was that cadet-lad
who for three years waved his sword in greeting to the
girl at the window!  I have never forgotten you."
</p>

<p>
"But when the face did not again appear at the
window?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw the stern visage replace yours, and afterward
there was a blank.  I had no way to reach you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," calmly, "the incident was closed.  My
betrothal was arranged, and you started on your
campaigns."
</p>

<p>
"I had no thought punishment would come to you."
</p>

<p>
"It came."
</p>

<p>
"My dear lady, I would have saved you at any cost
had I known.  My heart bleeds that I was in any way
the cause of tragedy in your life."
</p>

<p>
"You are more than kind, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could give back to you those lost years."
</p>

<p>
"Your wish is most generous, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Before an unwilling marriage should have been
forced on you I would have scaled those barbed walls
to bear you away with me, after the manner of the
knights of old."
</p>

<p>
"But you did not know.  The walls were unsealed.
From the girls' dormitory I went into life&mdash;and such
a life it has been!  The soldier-lad's life was different."
</p>

<p>
Her bosom was heaving, her breath coming in quick
catches.  She crumpled into a chair, and covered her
face with her hands.
</p>

<p>
"O, señora, señora!" moving a step nearer.
</p>

<p>
A storm of sobbing was the only reply.
</p>

<p>
He knelt by her side.
</p>

<p>
"O, señora!  My dear señora!"
</p>

<p>
He put his hand on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Look at me, my poor, crushed señorita of the
window pane."
</p>

<p>
She let one hand drop to her side, the other reached
to his.  The velvet eyes brimming with tears looked
piteously at him.
</p>

<p>
"I ask&mdash;I beg of you&mdash;O, señora&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Somehow she came into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Until to-day I never knew that you were the
señorita of the window."
</p>

<p>
"You were the knight who went to the wars and left
forlorn his lady."
</p>

<p>
A fresh sob convulsed her.  The compelling personality
of the señora was gone.  The imperious, beautiful
woman was submerged in a being clinging and
tender.
</p>

<p>
The man made an effort to speak, but his tongue
refused to obey.  Finally: "Señora, I too am desolate.
My sympathy for you is yet the greater because my
own heart has been bereft.  Señora&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A heavy foot was on the vestibule floor.  Colonel
Barcelo entered.
</p>

<p>
"Benito, the scoundrel, asleep in the sun!  Actually
asleep!  A pretty sentinel!  'Pon my soul!  I smell
coffee.  I've had no breakfast and am hungry as a
wolf."
</p>

<p>
He pushed forward.
</p>

<p>
"Why, here's Morando!  Glad some one was here in
my place to entertain you.  My wife's sister hasn't felt
herself since that confounded affair over on the
Mendoza grant.  He should be told of the birds of prey
that infest the place.  Time he should set those prize
native riflemen of his to killing off such pests.
Caramba! but that coffee smells good.  Is there any of it
left?"
</p>

<p>
Señora Barcelo had followed her husband into the
room.
</p>

<p>
"Crisostimo!  Why, you have not even said good
morning to the Captain!  Of course breakfast will be
ready for us at once."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so!  Hope so!  Morando, I heard this morning
the most wonderful sermon of my life.  Something
I didn't expect to be able to say in this town.  Padre
Osuna, of Mission San José, preached.  'Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not,' was
his text.  Applied it to the Indians of the province, our
duties to them, and all that.  I've never been so near
heaven in my life as when he was speaking.  Looked
at my watch when he began&mdash;force of habit, you know.
Looked again when he finished.  'Twas just fifty-seven
minutes.  I would have sworn it wasn't ten.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!" he called, in response to an insistent
knock at the door.
</p>

<p>
It was Benito.
</p>

<p>
"A messenger from Señor Berryessa is at the outer
gate.  He seeks Captain Morando.  Renegades last
night attacked some outlying corrals, killed and
wounded a number of vaqueros, then set off by starlight
toward the eastern passes, taking many cattle and
horses."
</p>

<p>
Morando hastened to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Pity you can't stay and have coffee with us," said
Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
The Captain's spurs were already jingling on the
pavement.  "Adios!" he called back.
</p>

<p>
"A fine fellow, that!" the Colonel remarked.  "Sorry
I was out when he first came.  In the new order I'll
have men enough to crush out the renegades once for
all.  The Captain won't be run so off his feet then."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br />
O'DONNELL SETTLES WITH YOSCOLO
</h3>

<p>
The luminous haze of late spring lay contentedly
over the Mendoza hacienda.  The noon hour had
come with its somnolent warmth; and all nature was
dozing in the sun, except the bumblebee, victim of
omnipresent unrest, and the hummingbird, which always
finds the day too short for its multifarious duties.
</p>

<p>
The peon workman, in from the fields, was satisfying
hunger in his whitewashed cot; or, the meal over, was
stretched on the earthen floor, a kerchief over his face,
enjoying the midday siesta.  The peona wife stepped
lightly around tidying the room, and then took place by
her husband's side, their children lying tumbled about.
</p>

<p>
Peace rested on the Indian adobe village which
flanked the hacienda house.  Inside the mansion itself
there reigned the stillness of night.
</p>

<p>
A footstep descending stairs somewhere seemed unusually
loud.  Finally a door opened, making a grating,
out-of-place sound.  Señor Mendoza's erect form
appeared on the west side of the courtyard.  He walked
leisurely toward an avenue shaded by the interlacing
branches of thick-leafed walnut trees.  A tiny brook
fed by a spring in the middle of the courtyard purled
along by his feet.  A grateful coolness lifted itself to
greet him.  The odor of damp earth mingled pleasingly
with the scent of flowers; and from under the south
wall of the inclosure came the rhythm of a miniature
waterfall as the brook lost itself on the rocks many feet
beneath.
</p>

<p>
The señor found that he was not alone in seeking the
leafed coolness of the walnut alameda.  The Doña
Carmelita was standing at the end of the walk listening,
apparently, to the music of the water.  Her hair, free
save where a golden clasp held it at the neck, gave play,
as it flowed over her back, to the beginning breezes from
the western sea.  The profile of her face was thoughtful.
Delicate lines traced the exquisite fullness of a form
straight and slender.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter is a beautiful woman!" he half ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
Many thoughts ran through his mind in panoramic
vision.  He recalled the long gallery in his father's
castle where had hung the pictured forbears of the de la
Mendoza.  Generations were there.  Their characteristic
form and features had descended to Carmelita.  No
government rule could prevent that, though it might
vent titles and confiscate lands.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter a woman!  A beautiful woman!"  The
thought half startled him.
</p>

<p>
The girl turned and walked toward him.
</p>

<p>
"Little papa!  Little papa mine! are you taking the
siesta on your feet?"
</p>

<p>
Carmelita's slender hands were on his broad shoulders,
and she was endeavoring to shake him.  Her merry
laugh pealed through the avenue.
</p>

<p>
"I smiled at you, and smiled at you, and blew kisses
at you, while you looked at me as if I were a thousand
leagues away, and you deigned never the least
recognition," standing on tiptoe and kissing him.
</p>

<p>
"I was living again the years of very long ago."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it, little papa."
</p>

<p>
She took his arm, and together they walked along the
avenue.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it, papacito," she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you not at the siesta?" disregarding her
question.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him demurely.
</p>

<p>
"I did not care to sleep.  Besides," jestingly, "we
must accustom ourselves to the ways of the Americano
who will soon come here.  You remember I have spoken
to you of Señor Brown, the man who was so thoughtful
in the cave the night of the storm?"
</p>

<p>
He pressed her arm tenderly in reply.
</p>

<p>
"I saw him lately in San José.  He told me, among
other things, that Americanos never sleep in the day,
and sparingly at night; indeed, often with one eye
open."  She laughed.  Her father joined.
</p>

<p>
"The Americanos are coming, you say?"
</p>

<p>
The girl stepped in front of him, placed her hands
against his breast and looked into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Papacito mio, since the baile you have slept not one
night at home, but in the morning returning with the
travel-stains of much riding.  Messengers are coming
and going between you and the bearded stranger after
whom Benito rode away so furiously in that early morning.
I know my little father too well to think he will
allow Señora Valencia and Hernandez and the others
to have their way so easily about England coming here.
Yes, the Americanos are coming, because you have
willed to have them come.  Papacito, I feel it."
</p>

<p>
"My child, England, the greatest power the world
knows, does not rely so much on Valencia and Hernandez,
nor yet the others, as on the wit of a very clever
woman, seconded by Captain Farquharson, principal
of your good friend, Brown."
</p>

<p>
The doña's arms fell to her side.  They resumed their
walk.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Farquharson also was very kind the night
of the storm."
</p>

<p>
"I do not forget that, little one.  When Padre Osuna
came to me, the evening of the baile, with word that
the Englishman was in straits, I intended to help
Farquharson, even by placing myself under obligation to
O'Donnell, which I would have disliked very much, at
that time."
</p>

<p>
"Why, papacito, did Padre Osuna come to you?"
</p>

<p>
The señor smiled.  "Señora Valentino."
</p>

<p>
The girl's eyes once more bent in thought.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Again the night in the cave," he laughed.  "I
am indebted to the padre, and could not have refused his
request to help the English captain, of which the señora
was well aware.  Immediately I divined O'Donnell to
be the real cause of Farquharson's predicament, and I
knew that he would gladly grant me the request, did I
make it, to free the captive.  The lady's mind ran the
gamut of the cause and effect."
</p>

<p>
"It is like an endless puzzle, my papa."
</p>

<p>
"Which the Captain solved of his own accord by
taking himself out of his plight, aided by Brown."
</p>

<p>
They walked a little while in silence.  Filipo, the
porter, looked in surprise at them from his high seat in
the lodge.  Usually he was the only person awake on
the hacienda at this hour.  His little beady eyes
followed them up and down, up and down the avenue.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter," the father finally said, "we have
in California, in a small way, an example of the game
of statecraft.  Europe plays on a larger scale, but it
is the same.  There, as here, the charm and brain of
woman supply the leverage for overturning states."
</p>

<p>
"I would not have thought Señora Valentino gifted
in that way."
</p>

<p>
"Six months ago the señora and Farquharson were
in Mexico City.  Don Juan Domingo told me of them.
O'Donnell also was there, but under an assumed name.
I too was there, though I saw none of the three.  The
lady's fame had followed her to the capital.  Her hand
has in no way lost its cunning here.  The older men&mdash;well,
we know how they accepted her wishes a few nights
ago; and the young men are at her feet.  No wonder."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino has won the padre to her side;
has influenced the well-poised Carillo, of the South, and
many others there.  She has, in the North, toyed with
men's intelligence whose balance I had never before
doubted."
</p>

<p>
The girl's eyes were straight ahead.  The father and
daughter went for a few moments without speaking.
</p>

<p>
The señor broke the quiet.  "Little one, if by any
chance future years shall see misfortune here, provision
has been made for thee across the seas.  The proceeds
of the lower hacienda, thy mother's, had she lived, have
been placed for thee in London's Bank of England.
Friends thou wilt find in England.  Their names are
written in my will.  Thou canst find protection there
always, should it ever fail thee here."
</p>

<p>
"California has been thy home, my father, and it
shall always be mine."
</p>

<p>
"A brave daughter and a loving one."
</p>

<p>
It was some time before further conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art a woman grown.  Though I married late
in life, yet may I still live to see thee on a husband's
arm."
</p>

<p>
She looked archly at him.  "There is Don Abelardo.
You know friends have said that his father and mine
arranged for a match."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but it is not true.  You are to have the making
of your own life."
</p>

<p>
"Papacito, my dueña says that more and more are
people speaking of this purported engagement.  I know,
of course, how the story began with the peons present
when Abelardo's father passed away in your arms; but,
why should such sudden interest arise now?"
</p>

<p>
"The peons understood little of Señor Peralta's words,
and spoke much, as Indians often do.  His utterance
touched the friendship of his family and mine, nothing
more.  Peralta would never have dreamed of betrothing
our children without their wish and consent; nor I of
entering such a compact, though such has been the
custom in Spain&mdash;a custom truly more honored in the
breach than the observance."
</p>

<p>
"But, papa, I don't want this idea that Abelardo and
I are engaged to be married to get so widely about.
What can we do?"
</p>

<p>
"Do nothing, my girl, do nothing.  Attention paid to
such things only nourishes their growth.  What does it
amount to, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
Filipo came over to them.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Morando, and many with him, are dropping
down the steep hills, and are coming in this direction.
The field glass shows them plainly."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza and his daughter walked toward the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Morando is one of the few who have not been
influenced by Señora Valentino.  He has maintained clear
head and uncompromised tongue.  Sword and glove he
has declared himself for Castilian manhood and womanhood.
I would be willing, as, indeed, should everyone,
to clasp hands with the señora on that declaration; as
did the Captain in the supper-room the night of the
baile.  I wish all my friends had held their wits against
this agent of Great Britain as firmly as he."
</p>

<p>
The señorita paled, then flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Pity that Morando thinks of leaving California.  I
have it not directly from him, but O'Donnell heard him
say that he intends to seek new fields as soon as he
can," continued the señor.
</p>

<p>
Morando and his soldiers rode to the gate and saluted
the Mendozas.
</p>

<p>
"I have several men who are rather severely wounded.
May I leave them here in your care while we push on
farther?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my friend, certainly.  But, Morando,
you are tired, I know; so are your men.  Alight, every
one of you, for rest and refreshment.  Filipo, call the
servants from the siesta."
</p>

<p>
The loud blast of Filipo's bugle brought life into the
hacienda house and around it.
</p>

<p>
"Muchas gracias, señor.  I cannot remain.  We have
been engaging Yoscolo since yester noon.  This
morning a large number of the renegades came to the front
and fought vigorously for a time.  Then they scattered.
Some of the prisoners have told us that, during
the fight, Yoscolo and a picked body of his men doubled
around us, intending to cut across the valley, and make
the Santa Cruz mountains at La Cuesta de los Gatos.
We must hurry in pursuit."
</p>

<p>
"Yoscolo, is it?  Caramba!" from Mendoza.  "In
an hour O'Donnell comes here.  I'll guarantee he will
be glad to ride with you after Yoscolo."
</p>

<p>
"I should be glad of his services, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But, wait, Captain.  O'Donnell will pick up the
rascal's trail as no other man can.  Before night he will
be riding in his heels.  Come, Morando, dismount.  Let
your men take the horses to the stables."
</p>

<p>
"I know of O'Donnell's value in such contests as
this; but the trail will be an hour colder."
</p>

<p>
"Not so, Captain.  The Indian will leave false tracks
in abundance.  The Americano frontiersman's eyes
will not be deceived.  Better wait, my friend."
</p>

<p>
Morando finally consented.  The wounded men were
cared for, and the weary men and horses were refreshed.
</p>

<p>
Before the hour was up the soldiers and their mounts
were outside the courtyard gate, ready for the order to
advance.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza went to the tower searching the horizon
with a field glass.  The Captain stood across the
courtyard waiting word from his host that O'Donnell had
come into sight.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita came out of a low door deeply let into the
side of the left wing of the house.  The hospital
department of the hacienda was there.  The girl was carrying
a flat vessel containing lint and bandages.
</p>

<p>
"Your wounded are as comfortable as possible, Señor
Captain," she said, as she passed Morando.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you and Señor Mendoza for it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Papacito is looking toward us and holding
up his hand to catch our attention."
</p>

<p>
"O'Donnell is in sight a league away," Mendoza's
voice came clearly to them.
</p>

<p>
"Gracias, Señor Mendoza," the soldier called in return.
</p>

<p>
The señor left the tower and walked along the roof
to an outside staircase.
</p>

<p>
The girl held up the lint and bandages.  "The peona
nurses and I prepared these for people injured on the
rancho.  I rejoice that we had them ready for to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Fortune favored us in being within such easy reach
of your ministrations, señorita doña.  One or two of
the men could not have gone much farther.  I shall
not forget your kindness."
</p>

<p>
"Not kindness, Señor Capitan!  A privilege and a
duty!  We are here in our stronghold, while you are
bearing the heat and the burden of the day.  Our
fruitful valleys smile the more happily because of your
protection."
</p>

<p>
"Your words are encouraging, señorita."
</p>

<p>
"I want to be more than encouraging.  I mean to be
appreciative.  I wish I knew how to say more."
</p>

<p>
"The señorita is good to the soldier.  In the name
of my comrades, I thank you."
</p>

<p>
Her face flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Captain, will you not be seated?  The shade of that
fig-tree invites you.  The afternoon may make much
call on your strength."
</p>

<p>
She took seat on a rustic chair and motioned him to
a bench in front of her fashioned around the tree-trunk.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad O'Donnell will assist in this work.  He is
a man who makes sure of his position before pushing
ahead," spoke Morando.
</p>

<p>
"Is the good Señor Americano, then, so infallible?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  Still, to err is human."
</p>

<p>
"But to forgive, divine, Señor Captain."
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Doña," hesitatingly, "perhaps there are
things humans can hardly be expected to forgive."
</p>

<p>
Again her face flushed, and she bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;and even if done under misapprehension."  Her
eyes looked straight at him.
</p>

<p>
"Of course the offense remains despite the
misapprehension&mdash;of course it remains," from Morando.  His
eyes sought the ground.
</p>

<p>
Neither spoke for a moment.  Peons were running
hither and thither.  Señor Mendoza had descended from
the roof and was sauntering toward them.  Filipo's
field glass pointed along the road leading up to the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita Carmelita, we can at least be friends.  Is
it not so?"
</p>

<p>
Mendoza was at their side.  "Captain, when did you
first find out about this raid?"
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday morning.  I had ridden to Monterey, to
call on Señora Valentino where the messenger came.  I
had some men with me.  The others came up at the
Berryessa rancho."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Filipo, I'm coming," in response to a signal
from the porter.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza walked briskly toward the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Friends!"  Carmelita arose, her eyes flashing.
</p>

<p>
Morando also arose.  "I do not consider my friendship
of light value, Señorita Doña Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"I do not share your high opinion of that friendship,
Captain Morando."
</p>

<p>
The loud challenge of O'Donnell's horse was heard.
</p>

<p>
"Morando!  Morando!" Señor Mendoza called.
</p>

<p>
"Coming immediately, señor.  Good afternoon,
señorita doña."  The Captain hastened to the
courtyard gate.
</p>

<p>
The señorita went up to her room, a storm raging in
her heart.
</p>

<p>
"If Captain Morando dares mention the name of
Señora Valentino in my presence again, I'll forbid him
ever to speak to me."  She clenched her hands.
</p>

<p>
The sound of many moving horses under her window
called her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
The soldiers were setting out.  Tomaso and a hundred
of Mendoza's fighting peons were with them.  Morando
and O'Donnell rode together, in earnest conversation.
</p>

<p>
"The place to find the scamp is always where you
would least likely think him to be," O'Donnell observed.
</p>

<p>
Yoscolo's trail was found at the Berryessa rancho,
where he had been the morning of the previous day.
The Indian had waited some time to obtain powder from
a cache in the hills, then started across the valley,
secure in the thought that Morando and his men were
miles away in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
About the middle of the afternoon he was overtaken
at La Cuesta de los Gatos, ten miles south of San José.
</p>

<p>
At sight of the pursuers Yoscolo intrenched himself
in a rocky cañon, which, he believed, could not be
approached by flank movements, while a successful frontal
attack seemed impossible.  Here he waited, intending
to slip away at night.
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell, on the stallion, followed by Tomaso and
his peons, scaled the rocky edge of a precipice, and
suddenly appeared on a ledge thirty feet above the
renegades.
</p>

<p>
"El Diablo!  El Diablo!" they shouted.
</p>

<p>
A number of shots were fired at O'Donnell.  He swung
under the horse's body, and the shots went wild.
</p>

<p>
The stallion braced its feet and slid down the cliff
followed by the others.
</p>

<p>
A terrible hand-to-hand conflict was waged.  Fortune
would favor one side, then the other.  Finally, the
two leaders came together in the middle of the little
valley at the head of the cañon.  The giant made thrust
after thrust of his lance at the Indian, who parried
successfully, pressing his opponent hotly in return.
</p>

<p>
The stallion's part in the combat was no small one.
He whirled his master out of harm's way, or pushed
into the fight, at a simple turn of the rein.
</p>

<p>
Yoscolo's horse stumbled.  The stallion sounded its
scream, and rushed against the other mount, throwing
it from its feet.
</p>

<p>
The Indian sprang free from his falling horse, and,
grasping O'Donnell's stirrup-strap, vaulted to the back
of Drumlummon.  His face snarled furiously as he
struck his knife at O'Donnell.  Before the blow could
fall a backward thrust of O'Donnell's lance ended the
outlaw's life.
</p>

<p>
Morando's command attacked the renegades' front.
The deep-shadowed cañon rang with carbine volleys,
the screaming of horses and the shouts of men.
</p>

<p>
The Indians were dismayed at the leader's fall, but
Stanislaus took charge, and urged on the fight.
Nightfall, however, saw the complete defeat of the robber
band.  Stanislaus was captured.
</p>

<p>
"I've settled with Yoscolo.  Now I'll ride to Mission
San José and finish my call on Mendoza," was O'Donnell's
laconic remark.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br />
FARQUHARSON MEETS WITH A LOSS
</h3>

<p>
"The Cap'n wants me to give this 'ere paper to
the padre and nobody else.  Consequently,
nobody else gets it."
</p>

<p>
"No sabe, señor."
</p>

<p>
Brown was standing outside the gate of Mission San
José.  The porter's face was wrinkled into lines of
firmness.  The caller had asked for Padre Osuna and
had held up a sealed envelope on which was written the
friar's name.  The man in the lodge had asked for the
communication, first in Spanish, then in the
world-known sign language.  Brown understood the signs,
but was determined to place the letter in the addressee's
hands himself.
</p>

<p>
"No such trouble go get to see the minister in my
country," Brown commented.
</p>

<p>
"No sabe, señor," again from the porter.
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand much, pore critter," said
Brown, unwittingly using the meaning of the other's
words.  "Well from them to whom little is given little
is to be expected; so, go to the deuce till I can find a
way to beat something into your thick head."
</p>

<p>
Brown's words were unintelligible, but his contemptuous
manner spoke plainly enough to the Indian, who
broke into a volley of indignant Spanish.
</p>

<p>
The American slipped the bridle reins over his horse's
head and led the animal across the street to the
Mendoza hacienda house.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza had just returned from riding.  A
half score of mounted Indian riflemen were a short
distance back of him.  The Administrator nimbly sprang
from his horse and awaited the newcomer.  Several of
the peons unslung their carbines from their shoulders,
but replaced them at a motion from the señor's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Can you talk American?" was Brown's characteristic
question.
</p>

<p>
Genuine amusement was in Mendoza's laugh.  "I am
not sure.  I can understand you, however.  I'm sure
of that."
</p>

<p>
Brown looked at the tall, gray man.  "I reck'n you're
the little girl's pop," he observed.  "She favors you
mightily in every way, 'cept in size and age.  Met her
again the other day in San José.  We was tickled to
death to see one another."
</p>

<p>
"So you are Brown..  I am very glad to meet you.
Allow me to thank you for your generous kindness to
my daughter and the lady with her that night in the
cave."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza advanced, his hand extended in hearty
greeting.  The American took the proffered hand with
a viselike grip.
</p>

<p>
"You bet I'm Brown&mdash;Simon James Brown.  Saint
Louis, Missouri, is my post office address.  I'm proud
to know ye, sir."
</p>

<p>
The señor recovered his hand from Brown after it
had been given a series of pump-handle shakes.
</p>

<p>
"What me and the Cap'n did for your folks the
night of the freshet gave us as much pleasure as it did
them," Brown continued in a mincing way, as if the
occasion demanded some special effort from him.
</p>

<p>
"I regret that I did not have opportunity that night
to thank you and your captain."
</p>

<p>
Brown wagged his head in a friendly way.  "Curious
feller is the Cap'n.  Mind, he's a decent chap to work
for and all that.  I like him better all the time; but
his ways are past finding out, you bet."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza bowed courteously to the stranger and
smiled obligingly.  "What you see before you, Señor
Brown, is yours.  Will you not enter?"  He waved his
hands over grounds and house.
</p>

<p>
Brown looked dubiously at the other.  The señor's
suave dignity forbade the thought that he was joking.
</p>

<p>
"I declare, I never had so much property before in
my life.  Does the deed go with it?"
</p>

<p>
Mendoza smiled and repeated his gestures.
</p>

<p>
"I don't reck'n I'll go in just now," he said dryly.
"You see, I'm workin' and my time isn't my own.  I'm
lookin' for the minister of that there church," pointing
to the Mission over the way.  "I can't make the feller in
the box catch my meanin'."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  You wish to see Padre Osuna?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the name written here," producing the envelope.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my friend.  Come with me.  I'll speak to
the porter for you."
</p>

<p>
"Señor Brown, shall I accompany you across the way?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll be much obleeged."
</p>

<p>
"Filipo!" called Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
Filipo understood.  He came out the gate, took the
horse's bridle from Brown, then clapped his hands
together sharply.  A peon boy came running.  The
porter gave quick command in Spanish.  The boy sprang
into the saddle and galloped after the riflemen.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;see here&mdash;" ejaculated the astonished Missourian.
"Why, I have to ride that nag to Monterey to-night!"
alarm beginning to show in his face.
</p>

<p>
"The horse will be fed and cared for, Señor Brown,"
assured Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see that you have a mount to Monterey."  Then
quickly: "You rode through the lower Santa Clara
from Monterey to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, I did."
</p>

<p>
"Saw no signs of renegades?"
</p>

<p>
"Nary sign.  Haven't seen a renegade since I swatted
a bunch over last week."
</p>

<p>
The two went in the direction of the Mission lodge.
Noting the erect figure and decisive step of the
Californian, Brown squared his heavy shoulders and
endeavored to walk in dignified fashion.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza said a few words to the lodge keeper.  The
gate opened noiselessly.
</p>

<p>
"Brown, you are to enter.  When your business is
over, come to my house.  Do not start for Monterey
until I see you again.  Will you promise, my
friend?"  The señor held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  I don't know where my horse is anyhow.
Besides, I'd enjoy to come in and set a spell."  He
administered several hearty handshakes.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza turned and walked toward his own gate.
</p>

<p>
"I declare," Brown soliloquized, "in my country that
'seenyore' there would have come right into the
preacher's setting room and stayed around a while."
</p>

<p>
The porter, by crooking his finger, indicated that
Brown was to follow him.
</p>

<p>
"All right," assented Brown.  "I'll follow where you
can lead anyway."
</p>

<p>
The Indian took him within the quadrangle.  The
busy life he saw attracted his attention.
</p>

<p>
"A lot of you folks do seem to be working at
something or other," he remarked to the porter.
</p>

<p>
"No sabe, señor," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me I heard you say something like that
before."
</p>

<p>
They came to the friar's apartments.  Juan Antonio
met them.
</p>

<p>
"Be you the Reverend?" asked Brown.
</p>

<p>
"No sabe, señor," from the old major-domo.
</p>

<p>
"That there 'pears to be a common remark," commented
Brown.
</p>

<p>
Juan Antonio signaled Brown to come with him.
</p>

<p>
"All right, 'seenyore,' I'm coming.  'Pears to me this
might be a likely place for a deaf-and-dumb man."
</p>

<p>
He was ushered into a small room well lighted by the
afternoon sun.  The padre arose to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"You wish to see me, brother?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Brown dropped his sombrero on the floor and made
the lowest bow of his life.  "I have a letter for you,
Reverend."
</p>

<p>
"A chair, my brother.  Ah!  I recognize the
handwriting," taking the letter.  "Kindly excuse me while
I read it."
</p>

<p>
"I shall return an oral reply to Captain Farquharson.
Say to him, 'Yes, I will see him.'"
</p>

<p>
"I'll do it."
</p>

<p>
The friar seated himself.  "I see you are not an
Englishman, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, I'm American, lock, stock, and barrel."
</p>

<p>
"I thought as much from your accent."
</p>

<p>
"My accent!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Your manner of speaking English is quite
different from that to which I have been accustomed."
</p>

<p>
"I speak good old United States," Brown said,
warmly.
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna laughed.  "I have met occasionally
sea-faring men here and trappers of your nationality."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon they do slop over into this country.  I
wish more of them would come.  But we are a long
way off when we are at home."
</p>

<p>
"Did you come here as a trapper or as a sailor?"
</p>

<p>
"Nary trapper; nary sailor.  I'm here on the proposition
of big game huntin'."
</p>

<p>
The padre made no reply, but looked intently at his
visitor.
</p>

<p>
Brown now felt that some remarks on matters
religious were due from him.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't been to church none in California because
I'm entirely ignorant of the prevailin' tongue," he
started in abruptly.  "It's no use to set under preachin'
if you don't understand the preacher."
</p>

<p>
The padre laughed.  "Certainly both preacher and
congregation would be at a disadvantage in such case."
</p>

<p>
"I've seen men around Monterey and elsewhere
dressed in the same way you are, but I haven't spoke to
them, bein' uncertain of their knowledge of my talk."
</p>

<p>
"I fear that not one of my brethren could understand
you."
</p>

<p>
"So I reckoned.  Now, I'm not a religious professor
at this time, though I'd delight to set under good
preachin'.  I and all my folks are hard-shelled
Baptists."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  But bein' mate on a Mississippi freight boat
and handlin' nigger deck hands begets an unregenerate
spirit."
</p>

<p>
"You found it so?"
</p>

<p>
"I did.  That was one of the reasons why I left
steam-boatin'.  Diversion and love of adventure were the
others."
</p>

<p>
"You say you came here on the proposition of big
game hunting.  You have, then, given up your project
for the time being to take service with Captain
Farquharson?"
</p>

<p>
"O, no, Reverend.  The Cap'n is here on the same
proposition.  When I first met him he was plum daffy
on big game.  The big game he wanted resided only in
California.  Now, being a man of the world, I'd mixed
a good deal with the huntin' of bear, et cetery.  I
reckoned I could do huntin' in a plain way on the Pacific
Coast, so I became first mate in the Cap'n's outfit, and
here I be."
</p>

<p>
The friar looked searchingly at Brown.  "Your outfit
is doubtless richer by many peltries at this time."
</p>

<p>
Brown laughed and slapped his thigh.  At the same
time a shrewd twinkle came into his eyes.  "Most curious
thing in nature!  The minute the Cap'n comes where
big game abounds he loses int'rest in said game
complete."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Certain and sure.  Never saw anything like it."
</p>

<p>
"How do you account for it?"
</p>

<p>
"The Cap'n's got cards up his sleeve.  Maybe I'm
wrong, and maybe I'm right; but, anyway, it's got
something to do with these Injun folks hereabouts."
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna was all attention.  "Why do you think
so?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Reverend, it's the result of my observin's."
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  Cap'n thinks this country should be
cultivated.  Talks free on this point.  Naturally, Injuns
will do the harvestin'.  Naturally, again, the Cap'n
will get his share of the harvest."
</p>

<p>
Father Osuna looked steadily at Brown.  "You think
Captain Farquharson would burden our Indians still
further?  Have they not been already plundered and
cast out?  Captain Farquharson's&mdash;our government
could not contemplate making their peonage more
complete.  It is impossible."
</p>

<p>
Brown, slowly moving from side to side in his chair,
eyed the padre.  "Reckon 'twon't hurt 'em to work a
sight more than they do.  Our niggers in the South
hustle and it does 'em good, besides creatin' wealth."
</p>

<p>
The friar paced nervously up and down the little
room.  "My poor children have been deprived of their
own; the labor of their hands is being exploited; the
welfare of their souls is forgotten.  Am I helping to
forge their fetters stronger?  God forbid."
</p>

<p>
Brown arose and picked up his hat from the floor.
"O, the Cap'n's a pretty good fellow, but smart, you
see!  He won't treat these 'ere natives worse than the
next one."
</p>

<p>
The friar did not heed him.  "This province goes to
England, doubtless.  If my little ones are oppressed,
I'll appear before the queen and demand their rights.
I'll claim my privilege of speaking in the House of
Commons.  The plagues of Egypt will fall on a land
which permits such infamy."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, Reverend, I'll be going."
</p>

<p>
"O, good-day, my friend.  Remember, 'Yes.'  Shall
I write it, or will you remember it?"
</p>

<p>
"I can recollect it all right.  Good-day, Reverend."
</p>

<p>
Brown made his way toward the lodge.  "Well, this
'ere does beat all Harry."  He paused and looked
around the courtyard.  "Well, this 'ere does beat all
Harry!  England, hey?  Well, by gosh!  Not much!
Big game!  Big game!  I attend my own business pretty
much, but here is the time for bein' nosy."
</p>

<p>
The porter opened the gate for him to pass out.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going' to see the 'seenyore' across the way, then
I start for an interview with the Cap'n," spoke Brown
to himself.
</p>

<p>
Filipo admitted him at the Mendoza gate and brought
him to the Administrator.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Señor Brown, a moment's chat with you."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather talk than eat."
</p>

<p>
"You shall do both."
</p>

<p>
A peon brought in refreshments.
</p>

<p>
"My good Brown, it is wiser that you stay here to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Simply can't do it.  One reason is, the Cap'n's
business.  The other is, my own business."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, partake of the food and wine.  You
can the better go on your journey."
</p>

<p>
Brown did as invited.  After a moment he said:
"Aren't some folks doin' more or less pull-hauling
toward makin' California English territory?"
</p>

<p>
"It is true.  Haven't you known it for some time?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should say not!" contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Your preferences are not English?"
</p>

<p>
"My family," emphatically, "has spilled too much
blood fighting 'em, for that.  Not," apologetically, "but
what some pretty good Britishers exist; but if anybody
gets this country, it's Uncle Sam."
</p>

<p>
"Have you spoken in this way to the Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't got round to it yet.  You bet I do before
this time to-morrow.  Then I strike the long trail back
to old Missouri, either on ship or on shank's mare."
</p>

<p>
"If you leave your present employment at any time,
I wish you would apply to me before going farther.
Well, here comes my daughter."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita greeted the American cordially.  "I am
delighted to see you in my father's house."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon it's a good place to be in.  Wish I could
stay longer, but I'm anxious to get to Monterey."
</p>

<p>
He was obdurate to Mendoza's urging him to remain
as his guest till more could be learned as to the
renegades.
</p>

<p>
"I can travel by night along a trail I know.  They
won't see I'm not one of themselves.  All men look alike
in the dark."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza, greatly reluctant, allowed Brown to be off.
He sent a strong guard of fighting peons with him.
</p>

<p>
"Reckon it's the proper caper to travel in style now
I'm a landed proprietor.  Gosh!  Wouldn't my dad be
proud to see me now!"
</p>

<p>
"When you come to this house you come to your
own," the host had insisted at parting.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Mendoza is a tolerable generous old gent,"
Brown remarked to the leader of peons who rode by his
side.
</p>

<p>
"No sabe, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Well, your ignorance is thick enough to be cut with
a knife.  Hey?"
</p>

<p>
"No sabe, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Well," resignedly, "that is about all I've been able
to get out of men like you for months."
</p>

<p>
They were presently in San José.  The pueblo was in
an almost hysterical state.  Morando had drawn with
him nearly all the men capable of bearing arms.  Rumors
were flying about that the Spanish force had been
cut to pieces and that Yoscolo was about to descend
on the country.
</p>

<p>
Brown did not understand a word of what was being
said.  He insisted on starting for Monterey.  The
peon leader ordered his men to detain him by force.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh darn yer!  Gosh darn yer!" the American
shouted.  "Leggo my horse!  Leggo my horse, I say!"
</p>

<p>
He loosed both feet from the stirrups and kicked
lustily.  The natives grasped his legs and hung on like
pendant weights despite the rear of the mount.  He cut
about him with his riding-whip.  The peons literally
swarmed over him, pinioning his arms from front and
behind, meanwhile shouting objections, curses,
explanations in mingled Spanish and Indian.
</p>

<p>
"Shut off your gibberish!  Shut off your gibberish,
I say!  I've got to light out o' here.  Get off my back!
I've got to get the Cap'n," Brown yelled.
</p>

<p>
"I'm here, Brown."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson had ridden up unobserved.
</p>

<p>
"I heard things were stirring around here and I came
to find out about it," he continued.  "I knew I should
meet you on the way."
</p>

<p>
The peons released Brown at a word from the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"These men were saying you must stay here and help
defend the women and children."
</p>

<p>
"Cap', I'm mighty glad to see you.  Well, what
about the women and children?"
</p>

<p>
"It will not be necessary.  Yoscolo has been bested.
The fight is over, and the wounded are already nearing
the outskirts of the pueblo here."
</p>

<p>
"All well and good.  Now, Cap', the padre's word
to you is 'Yes.'"
</p>

<p>
"I understand, Brown."
</p>

<p>
"Now I have a word."
</p>

<p>
"Very well."
</p>

<p>
Brown dismounted and came close to Farquharson.
"Are you aimin' to turn California over to the British?"
</p>

<p>
The Captain smiled broadly.  "Now, see here, Brown,
we've got along famously for months.  You haven't
asked questions and haven't suffered any loss by not
doing so.  Now let things run along the same old way.
You've been useful to me.  I'll see you get a great deal
more than the money I've paid you month by month."
</p>

<p>
"Cap', you can explain away things about the best
of any man I ever saw; but this here is principle with
me.  There isn't any explaining it away.  As I said, I
don't care a durn for this country.  It's too fur out.
But if I help anybody get it, that anybody is Uncle
Sam."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Brown, that's sentiment.  Your Uncle Sam
doesn't want the country.  If he does, why hasn't he
made it his own long ago?  The truth is, the United
States already has more territory than it knows what
to do with.  England can use California to splendid
advantage.  The people here are crying for her to come.
Brown, her coming is inevitable."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so.  Just the same, I don't put my shoulder
to her wheel and push her in here.  No, sir!"
</p>

<p>
Farquharson placed his hand on Brown's arm.  "See
here, my friend, I don't forget you risked your life
for me that afternoon in Monterey."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Cap'.  I'll remark here, there's
nothing personal to you in my present position."
</p>

<p>
"Well, stay with me.  Ask no questions, and I'll see
you have a grant of land here twenty times the size of
your average Missouri farm."
</p>

<p>
"Not if I'm to help you or anyone to make this place
over to England.  Whatever I've done in that way
previous was without my knowledge."
</p>

<p>
"Brown, we shall leave our hill-camp immediately and
live in Monterey.  You will have nothing to do but
carry messages for me.  Stay on, now, like a good
fellow, and in a half dozen years you can visit your old
Missouri home as a rich man."
</p>

<p>
"No use, Cap'.  I've never been so sorry to quit a
man, but I have to go."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Brown, if being a landed proprietor doesn't
appeal to you, why not stay on the basis of the
friendship that has grown between us?"'
</p>

<p>
"I'm your friend all right, Cap', but I can't do a
thing that would make my old pop back in Missouri
ashamed of me.  Don't ask that."
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell appeared from somewhere.  Powder-stains
streaked his hair, face, and beard.  His clothing was
cut and torn, but his step was steady and firm.  His
eyes looked straight into Farquharson's.  The
Englishman returned him look for look.
</p>

<p>
"Brown, you know where to find me."  The Captain
held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
Brown shook it warmly.  "Good-by, Cap'."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson mounted his horse and moved slowly
away.  O'Donnell and Brown were left alone.
</p>

<p>
"You and your 'Cap'n' have been having words?"
O'Donnell asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sounded like it, did it?"
</p>

<p>
"I presume you do not know he is in the province for
political reasons?"
</p>

<p>
"If I was of an inquiring turn of mind, I'd ask what
business it is of yours whether I do or not."
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell laughed.  "No business at all, friend
Brown&mdash;no business at all.  I happen to be a lover of the
Stars and Stripes; consequently, no friend of Captain
Farquharson's political intrigues here.  Do you
understand?"
</p>

<p>
"More or less.  It's the Stars and Stripes for me too,
every time!"
</p>

<p>
"You are a likely-looking man.  Since you have left
Farquharson I'll offer you place with me.  You will
find it active, full of excitement, and with pay not
small."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Irishman, but I don't intend to
work any more for strangers.  It's like buying a pig
in a sack.  'Seenyore' Mendoza offered me two things
this afternoon, one was his house and farm, t'other was
a job.  I'll think I'll take the job.  Otherwise, it's me
for old Missouri."
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell again laughed.  "Very well, then, take
service with Señor Mendoza.  I'll ride to Mission San
José later in the evening, and I intend to call on
Mendoza myself.  Would be glad of your company, if you'll
come along with me."
</p>

<p>
The wounded began to come in on improvised litters.
O'Donnell and Brown gave their assistance toward
bringing them into comfortable quarters.  Many of the
men did not return from the field of La Cuesta de los
Gatos.  There was lamentation in hacienda house and
in peon cot that night in the valley of Santa Clara.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing more for us to do here, Brown.  Are
you ready to start for Mendoza's?"  It was midnight
and the wounded had been cared for.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  I'll go with you."
</p>

<p>
They set out, the fighting peons following, their ranks
sadly decimated by the afternoon fight.
</p>

<p>
"Blamed sorry to leave the Cap'n," Brown volunteered.
"He's a decent chap, and smart&mdash;well, about
the best educated man I ever saw&mdash;and spunky&mdash;I'll
never forget how he half raised up from that stair-landing
in Monterey, like a shot weasel standing off a
pack of dogs.  Fire was just spitting from his
eyes&mdash;just spitting!"
</p>

<p>
"But his politics," O'Donnell interpolated.
</p>

<p>
"His politics ain't mine," Brown sighed.
</p>

<p>
They rode on in silence.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br />
SEÑORA VALENTINO AND CAPTAIN MORANDO
<br />
CONTINUE CONVERSATION
</h3>

<p>
"Saul has slain his thousands, but David his tens
of thousands.  I greet you, Captain Morando."
</p>

<p>
Morando bowed.
</p>

<p>
"A chair, Captain.  My good brother-in-law the
Colonel Barcelo awakes soon, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"If you do not mind, Señora Valentino, let us walk
up and down this wide veranda.  I think you were doing
so a moment ago."
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Señor Captain."
</p>

<p>
The señora and the soldier were on a long balcony in
the second story of the Barcelo mansion.  It ran along
the street side of the house and across one end.  The
cool wind from the Monterey Bay crept along the
street, mounted to the porch, and breathed gently there.
The leaves crinkled under the chill and the flower petals
shrank within themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Benito had strict orders to keep awake and bring
you here the moment you arrived, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"The watchful sentinel was indeed awake and lost no
time in showing me here, señora."
</p>

<p>
"At midnight I left the Colonel and his council.  They
had just finished reading the dispatches you sent.  They
expected you and your prisoners along shortly.  They
were to wait for you in these chairs, but I fancy the cool
morning invited them within.  I fancy, again, one could
easily find the Colonel and his council."  She shrugged
and laughed.  They paused just opposite a wide-open
door.  Within were several men, in easy chairs, fast
asleep.  Colonel Barcelo, especially, was breathing
stoutly.  Two soldiers, evidently detailed as orderlies,
were on guard.  They rose from their chairs, saluted
the Captain, and again seated themselves, all silently
as if in pantomime.
</p>

<p>
The señora and the Captain continued their walk.
</p>

<p>
"I expected to arrive here much sooner, but had
difficulty in getting enough horses.  We were obliged to
sequester a number from the Mission Santa Clara.
Many mounts, as well as many men, were killed or
maimed in the fight, and we had nearly two hundred
prisoners to transport to the military prison here."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Captain, my heart rejoices in your victory and
in your safety.  Do you soldiers ever think that while
you are away fighting we women are home inactive, save
in prayer, waiting, longing for word of you, yet
dreading to hear it when it comes?  In the rush of battle,
amigo, does one little thought ever go back to these
waiting ones?"
</p>

<p>
"My good señora, not a moment since I left you two
days ago has the thought of one woman been absent
from me.  Yesterday, in that desperate hand-to-hand
fight, time after time we were hard pressed, and the
memory-picture of her moved my soul and placed a
giant's strength in my arm.  The men caught my
spirit."
</p>

<p>
"The thought of one woman, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, señora.  It may be women little realize the part
they have in bringing to success many a perilous
enterprise."
</p>

<p>
"It is good to hear you say that, my Captain."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, often when we are most occupied there runs
in us an undercurrent of thought which reaches a surer
conclusion, perhaps, than could our conscious reason.
In these past busy hours my deeper self has lived again
and again in the words you and I spoke that morning
in the reception room below.  When opportunity comes
I shall give you further confidences of my heart."
</p>

<p>
"I am greatly complimented by what you tell me."
</p>

<p>
"Had I but time that morning I should have gone to
greater length.  My dear señora, a common bond unites
you and me.  Providence, I doubt not, has brought us
together in understanding, after all these years, that
we may help each other."
</p>

<p>
"Captain, I&mdash;I feel&mdash;I need help.  And you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My good señora, I shall give help as I can.  From
you I ask the same consideration.  That morning I was
about to say to you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The church bell rang.  The hour was six, the time for
the morning Angelus.
</p>

<p>
"The angel of the Lord declared unto Mary," Colonel
Barcelo's voice repeated half sleepily.  The soldiers
and the council all joined in the morning prayer.
</p>

<p>
"I must have nodded," the Colonel added.  "A moment
ago I was the only one awake around here, but I didn't
care to disturb these civilians who aren't accustomed
to night duty," looking indulgently at his council.
"But as for the soldiers," glaring at the orderlies, "why,
they simply are no soldiers at all.  Many's the time
I've gone eighty hours without sleep, eighty hours,
señors! and never closing an eye.  Why, bless my soul! here
is Morando, a trifle dusty and smoke-stained, but
still fresh as a rose.  Congratulation, good Captain!
I'm glad you rubbed out that rascally Indian.  Why,
here's Señora Valentino also!  I suppose the Angelus
bell aroused you.  Well, I was awake.  Sit down,
Morando.  Take this easy chair."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel arose and walked about the room.
"Well, tell us about the fight&mdash;I'm beginning to get
hungry."
</p>

<p>
"Lieutenant Mesa, who came to you last night, told
you, I'm sure, all there is to tell.  One of the prisoners,
however, told me something interesting about the
Americano O'Donnell and Yoscolo."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  O'Donnell," from Señora Valentino.  "Let us
hear about it."
</p>

<p>
"I wondered why Yoscolo deserted the coast range
whence he could have easily reached the high Sierras
and safety," began Morando.  "This Indian prisoner
told me that Yoscolo abandoned the Sierras for fear of
O'Donnell himself."
</p>

<p>
"For fear of O'Donnell!" Barcelo ejaculated in
contempt.  "That Indian was simply talking nonsense.
I've seen this O'Donnell around here&mdash;some nondescript
fellow.  Besides, O'Donnell wasn't in the Sierras at all,
but right along with you.  Well, we'll all feel better
when we've had some breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"What further did your informant say, Captain
Morando?" Señora Valentino persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Yoscolo thought O'Donnell had gone to the far-western
plains.  The Americano is most influential there
with high chiefs.  So, our Yoscolo intended to raid the
missions and haciendas, hold Spanish men and women
for ransom and make his way with the proceeds to
Northern Mexico, all before O'Donnell should return.
He knew the Americano could overwhelm him with those
plains natives, if he wished.  But O'Donnell had not yet
gone to the plains.  Yoscolo only became aware of this
after he began raiding.  Accordingly, he left the
neighborhood of danger, and was on his way along the coast
to Mexico, for safety, when we overtook him at Los
Gatos."
</p>

<p>
"Simply preposterous!  Simply preposterous! what
the Indian told you," puffed Barcelo.  "Well, it was
as good a way as any to pass a weary journey.  But
let's go to breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Whither went O'Donnell after the action at Los
Gatos?" still persisted Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"After giving aid to the wounded in San José he rode
to the house of Señor Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
Señor Barcelo appeared on the veranda.
</p>

<p>
"Crisostimo, will you kindly tell our amigos that
breakfast will be ready in fifteen minutes?  Silvia and
you, Crisostimo, help me show them rooms where they
may prepare.  Sister, love, have a care for your arm.
Come, amigos, come."
</p>

<p>
The guests were soon disposed to their rooms.
</p>

<p>
As they left the breakfast table, Señora Valentino
said to Morando: "Captain, shall we not continue the
conversation interrupted by the ringing of the Angelus?"
</p>

<p>
"With great pleasure, my señora."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go into the courtyard garden."
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo and his councilors returned to the
upper veranda.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have to be at the castle when Morando turns
these prisoners over to me formally, and withdraws his
own men.  I'll see to it that horses will be there for us,
and we'll go out on a tour of inspection," Barcelo said.
</p>

<p>
"How softly the morning light comes into the patio,
Captain!" as they were sitting together under a locust
tree.
</p>

<p>
"I can scarcely realize that the same sun shines here
and on that scene of death of few hours' ride away.  As
I sit here with you in this quiet and peace the other
seems a dream, an awful dream, señora."
</p>

<p>
"But you are with me, and yesterday has gone the
way of all other days that are past.  The future, if we
are willing, may hold many happy years for us."
</p>

<p>
"I pray so, my good señora."
</p>

<p>
The señora lowered her eyes, and bowed gently.
</p>

<p>
"Our lives are empty; yours, because it has never
been filled.  Hence there is greater hope for you than
for me."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"You have been frank with me.  I will be the same
with you.  Fate brought me to far-away California.  I
chanced to meet the one who from the first filled my
heart, my soul.  I sang beneath her window.  She
laughed.  Sometimes I thought she encouraged me.
Sometimes, again, she flouted me.  Nevertheless, I
dared hope she cared for me.  Now I know she did not."
</p>

<p>
The Captain paused in thought.
</p>

<p>
The señora did not speak.
</p>

<p>
Finally Morando continued: "More than once I tried
to tell her I loved her, but she held me at arm's length.
The night of the baile, at Mission San José, I believed
my opportunity had come.  She listened to me, favorably
I was sure; but there was an interruption from her
partner for the next dance.  When again she was alone
I pressed my suit.  It was in vain.  She seemed
changed&mdash;offended.  Yesterday I was at her father's house.  I
talked with her.  At first she listened most graciously;
then, in some way, I offended her still more.  I am
speaking of the Señorita Carmelita Mendoza, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Captain," came slowly from the señora, "we were
speaking the other day of the face of the window pane
in old Pilar Convent."
</p>

<p>
"I shall never forget, my dear señora."
</p>

<p>
"That face called in you to the primeval love every
man has for an ideal woman.  For her your heart had
been unconsciously searching.  The Señorita Mendoza
seemed to you to fulfill that ideal.  You went to her
with words of love.  She could not reciprocate.  Does
it not mean that you must look beyond the beautiful
child of Señor Mendoza for the realization of your
heart's desires?"
</p>

<p>
Morando looked straight at the señora.  "Señora
Valentino, I love the Señorita Mendoza with every fiber
of my being.  I shall never cease to love her.  I could
not bear to stay here and see her the wife of another
man.  Therefore I have resolved to go away.
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Captain, time has worked wonders.
It may do so for you."
</p>

<p>
Morando shook his head.  "Nothing can alter my
love for the señorita doña."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Captain!  You believe that the señorita doña
fulfills your ideal; yet you cannot wed her.  There may
be another destined to fit into the high place to which
you, not knowing, have called this child.  Think, my
friend, may it not be so?"
</p>

<p>
"It cannot be.  Señora Valentino, now that I have
lost Señorita Mendoza, the memory-pictures of her come
to me with tenfold intensity.  I saw her, as if near me,
on the battlefield.  I dreamed of her in the short hours
of sleep that have been mine since I last saw her.  Yes,
dear friend, even now, as you sit by, with words of
comfort for me, I see plainly the face and form of
Carmelita Mendoza.  She seems even more present to
me than are you."
</p>

<p>
The señora arose.
</p>

<p>
He stood beside her.  "I thank you for listening to
me.  Wheresoever I may be I shall never forget you."
</p>

<p>
"Let us again be seated."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, señora."
</p>

<p>
"I soon return to Europe," the señora said.  "My
work here is really done.  Great Britain gains another
province, and will be correspondingly thankful to her
who was useful in bringing about the transfer.  Good
Captain, I have other claims on Great Britain's good
will.  Should you desire some important post on the
continent, or elsewhere, I can see to it that the
diplomatic interest of England is used to secure it for you.
Since you feel you must leave here, my Captain, return
to Europe, take what good fortune sends you, and again
you will be the knight of the Lady of the Window Pane,
and she will rejoice in the victories you win for her."
</p>

<p>
Morando lifted the señora's hand to his lips.  "Do
not think I am unmindful, kind friend, of your goodness
to me.  I appreciate it most sincerely.  But, señora, I
could not accept your generous offices."
</p>

<p>
"But, Captain, there are many aspirants for the
high places.  Worth is but one of the requirements.
Another is to have a friend at court.  I can point out to
you the short paths to preferment, and can assist you.
I soon return to Europe.  Why not you do the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Again I thank you, señora.  Europe is too crowded;
therefore I left it.  I could not accept preferment there,
or here, unless I had earned it.  South America offers
to me the most inviting field at this time.  Before long
I shall turn my steps in that direction."
</p>

<p>
"You are diffident, Captain, and overscrupulous.
Europe is the world.  Go there.  Accept what offers
itself, and you will find your capabilities are equal to
the task."
</p>

<p>
Again Morando shook his head.  "Señora Valentino,
there is one thing that I would like to ask you to do for
me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"I seem to make matters worse by speaking to Señorita
Mendoza myself.  Would you go to her and tell her
for me that&mdash;O, that&mdash;that I didn't know of her
engagement to Peralta, and that I had no wish to annoy
her, and all that?  Explain it all to her.  You will know
better what to say than I can tell you&mdash;only tell her
that, no matter what, I shall always love her truly, and
that I shall never love anyone else."  He bowed his head
in his hands, overcome by his own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
She arose quickly, her eyes striking fire.  He was too
preoccupied to notice.  Her hands clenched and then
relaxed, in excess of nervous tension.
</p>

<p>
"You wish me to tell the señorita that you love her,
that you meant no offense in so telling her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo's loud voice called, "Morando!
Morando!  I say, Morando!"
</p>

<p>
The Captain aroused himself.  "Here, Colonel.  Here
in the garden."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel rushed into the patio, mopping his face
with his handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose that Stanislaus of yours has
done now, Captain?  What do you suppose he has done,
I say?"
</p>

<p>
"What has he done, Colonel?"
</p>

<p>
"Done!  Why, my council and I were to inspect some
irrigating ditches in the hills, to see the dams were well
built and all that, so the town would be in no danger of
inundation.  Do you understand?"  The Colonel glared
around.  "Well, the horses were tied outside the castle
for the use of myself and my council in this work of
inspection&mdash;in this work of inspection, do you
understand?  Well, your men looked bedraggled and tired,
Morando.  I didn't wait for you to come, but relieved
them and put my own soldiers on guard."
</p>

<p>
"But the prisoners&mdash;&mdash;" Morando began.
</p>

<p>
"That's just what I'm coming to.  Do be patient!
In the exchange of guards some of the prisoners walked
out&mdash;coolest thing I ever heard of&mdash;took rifles from the
racks, and actually mounted the horses in front of the
castle, and rode away!  I tell you, <i>rode away</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Barcelo paused for breath.  "I saw them going and
gave the alarm," he went on, after a moment.  "Yes, I
saw that rascal Stanislaus riding&mdash;riding away to
safety.  I saw it myself&mdash;I saw&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Further words failed the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
The sound of cavalry was heard in the street.
</p>

<p>
"The pursuit!" cried Morando and started for the
patio gate.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, the pursuit!" panted Barcelo and rolled
after him.
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino listened while Morando's clarion
voice ordered the movements of the cavalry, and heard
the noise of the horses' hoofs die out in a distant rumble.
</p>

<p>
"Our Colonel was out of breath and could not order
the march of his men, therefore our valiant Captain does
it for him!" she thought.  Then she smiled bitterly.
"I have laid bare my very soul before that man, and
he could see nothing.  He saw only that child,
Carmelita Mendoza.  What fatality is it that closes the
eyes of the one man to me and makes him see only this
miss of the province?"
</p>

<p>
Again, after a little: "Yes, I'll see his señorita for
him, tell her he loves her, and doesn't mean his
blunderings.  Yes, I'll tell her.  The fool!  Yes, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The señora walked away, her eyes glittering.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br />
BITTER SWEET
</h3>

<p>
"Carmelita, little heart, how is it with thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, señora doña; many thanks.  And thou?"
</p>

<p>
"As you see."  Señora Valentino held up her injured
wrist neatly bandaged.
</p>

<p>
"I could not allow many days to go by without
riding over to thank you and your father, the noble
Señor Administrator, for the wonderful night of
enjoyment you gave us in that grand baile.  The thought
of it fairly possesses me now, as it was some
beautiful dream and I was scarce awake from sleep.  A
thousand thanks, señorita doña, to you and to Señor
Mendoza.  I hope the señor is well."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino and Carmelita were standing within
the reception room, near the open doorway, of the
Mendoza hacienda house.  The grateful coolness of
the hall was in strong contrast to the heat of the
summer sun which lay over grounds and house.
</p>

<p>
"You are good, señora.  My father has been away
since yesterday.  I shall make your words known to
him on his return.  On my own part I thank you for
them."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino placed her well arm around the
girl.  "The beautiful hostess of a beautiful home is the
Señorita Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"Will you not step within, señora?  All that you see
is yours."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita moved toward the inner room, thus
disengaging the señora's arm.
</p>

<p>
"With much pleasure, señorita."
</p>

<p>
Shortly the two were seated.
</p>

<p>
"How refreshing is this inner air," remarked the
señora.  "The afternoon brings warmth and drowsiness,
but this is delightful."
</p>

<p>
"Modesta," from Carmelita to her maid who appeared
in response to the tinkle of a bell, "some tea
and dulces at once."
</p>

<p>
Without delay the refreshments appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Sugar, señora mia?" the young hostess holding
up a delicate gold spoon.  "Yes.  And dulces?  Modesta,
take this to Señora Valentino.  Have a care for her
bandaged wrist."
</p>

<p>
"Mille gracias, little hostess mine."  Then, sipping
the tea and nibbling the cakes, "These are delicious
after the ride, señorita doña."
</p>

<p>
"Have you come far, señora?"
</p>

<p>
"From the hacienda house of Señor Calderon, near
San José pueblo.  Merely a matter of two hours or
so, but I seem to tire easily since my arm was injured.
Still, what of it?  Soon it is well and then forgotten.
It is the way of unpleasant things, señorita.  They
slip away and we know them no more.  Well, if it were
otherwise, perhaps half of the world would be enemy
to the other half."
</p>

<p>
She laughed merrily and the hostess politely joined.
</p>

<p>
"Yet, in forgetting the unfortunate incident I would
not, if I could, forget the kindly ministrations of our
dear friend Captain Morando.  We were riding along
in the romantic coolness of early dawn&mdash;absorbed in
other things, you know&mdash;not noting or caring"&mdash;smiling
knowingly into the other's face&mdash;"when that
dreadful creature assailed me with its beak and claws."  The
señora turned away with a little shudder.  Then,
as if half absently: "But our soldier lad&mdash;how gently
he cared for me.  When I awakened&mdash;my head pillowed
against his breast as a child lying close to its mother's
heart."  Starting up, "But, Carmelita mia, I must not
distress you.  I am an unworthy disciple of my own
creed, for one minute I advocate forgetting troubles,
then I straightway recount them; but then, you see,"
looking down, "my troubles in this particular were
most sweetly intermingled."  She laughed and
immediately changed the subject.  "When do you expect the
señor your noble father to return?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know the time of his return, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Has he gone far?"
</p>

<p>
"When he left he did not tell me his destination, so I
fancy he has not gone to any great distance."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well!  We women wait while the men travel
forth to dare and do.  It's the way of the world."
</p>

<p>
The woman and the girl sat facing each other.  The
closed shutters excluded the sun, but the warm light
of a California summer day glowed in the room.  Less
than five years divided the ages of the matron and the
maid.  At first sight it might seem that the difference
was greater.  The tightly fitting riding-habit of the
señora added a maturity to her look which was not
usual, while the looser afternoon gown of the girl gave
her an uncommonly youthful appearance.  Carmelita
was somewhat taller than the señora and more slender.
</p>

<p>
"I hope your arm has not greatly inconvenienced
you," from Carmelita, by a strange perversity reverting
to the matter so lightly dismissed by the señora a
moment ago.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and no, señorita.  The wound is sometimes
painful, but the solicitude of those about me shows me
I have a place in their hearts&mdash;a pleasant knowledge&mdash;an
anodyne, so to speak."  She put her hand up to her
head in a childish way which was very becoming.  Her
oval face beamed with friendliness, while her brown
eyes smiled sweetly.  She was a very handsome young
woman, apparently very friendly and very genuinely
interested in the girl before her.  Carmelita was not
insensible to her charm.
</p>

<p>
"You have a place in the hearts of many, señora.
Surely you could never doubt it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps not.  Still, one wishes outward
expression of inward regard.  Otherwise, how can one
be sure it exists?"
</p>

<p>
Señorita Mendoza said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Then, too, we wish, naturally, to know just how
a certain very few stand toward us&mdash;sometimes just
how a certain one person feels toward us.  Now, there
are some who are very good to all.  Their hearts are
kind naturally, and they give generous words and deeds
to anyone who needs them.  Is it not so, señorita?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe you speak truly, señora doña."
</p>

<p>
The señora's laugh was merry as she said: "A wise
puss you are.  Well, this generous, free-for-all
kindness is good, but not entirely satisfactory.  Each
person has an ideal, and when we see that ideal realized
in some concrete person we want that person to be
good to us alone.  Do you not agree, señorita?"
</p>

<p>
"It would be presuming in me to contradict the
señora."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I said you are a wise puss, my señorita; and
so you are, very wise.  Well, wisdom is the heritage
of our old Castilian families.  Truly, our fathers have
thought of much and have done much in the generations
that have been lived.  What wonder if the rich,
pure gold of experience falls to us, the heirs of the
past, from the melting-furnace of departed years.
What think you, little lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Your thoughts rise above me, Señora Valentino."
</p>

<p>
The señora laughed and bowed, as if in acceptance
of some compliment.
</p>

<p>
The peona Modesta appeared in the doorway, curtseying
several times.  "May I speak, señorita doña?"
</p>

<p>
"Speak, Modesta."
</p>

<p>
"The post surgeon from San José is here to see the
wounded soldiers in our infirmary.  He wishes to leave
some directions with you."
</p>

<p>
"What soldiers does the peona mean, señorita?"
</p>

<p>
"Some disabled men Captain Morando left with us
the other day."
</p>

<p>
"O, indeed!  My husband was an officer, and I am
always much interested in soldiers, especially those
injured on the field of battle.  In San José yesterday
I visited the improvised hospitals.  I should like greatly
to see the men you have here and express my appreciation
of their good work."
</p>

<p>
"Why, certainly, señora.  Will you excuse me for
a few minutes now while I speak to the doctor?"
</p>

<p>
The señora listened to the sound of voices in the
corridor.  A demure look stole over her face.  She
arched her shoulders coquettishly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll tell the Señorita Mendoza that Captain
Morando loves her deeply and meant no harm when
he proposed to her.  I'll do just as the gallant Captain
asked me to do.  The fool!"
</p>

<p>
A look of weariness possessed her almost immediately.
"O, this life! this life!  Political intrigue! and
counter intrigue! all heartless and unfeeling as a
surgeon's knife.  God of my heart! why has destiny
discovered such a groove for me?  And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;what
would life be without it&mdash;without ambition?  A
body without a soul."
</p>

<p>
After a moment she arose, her hands clinching.
</p>

<p>
"The gallant Captain shall come to me and sue for
my love, if for no other reason than because I have
humbled myself before him.  I will it!  I will it!  As
for this puss&mdash;this wise puss&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The señorita's steps came quickly along the corridor.
She found the señora sitting in the chair, as she
had left her, to all intents musing the time away.
</p>

<p>
"The Captain Morando still pursues Stanislaus, the
elusive&mdash;so I heard this morning in San José.  My
brother-in-law, the Colonel Barcelo, has returned to
Monterey in disgust, having given up the chase.  You
know the old saying, señorita, 'The braver in war, the
keener in love.'  The Captain is both a brave soldier
and a keen lover."  The señora's full-throated, musical
laugh seemed out of place.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita was very quiet as she asked: "What do
you mean, señora doña?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, dear child, I mean that a braver man has
never drawn sword in the Californias, and surely
no one doubts his earnestness in making love."
</p>

<p>
The girl's face flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Did you know that the Captain and I first knew
each other about ten years ago?  No?  The inception
of our acquaintance was quite interesting.  Would you
like to hear about it?"
</p>

<p>
"If the señora wishes to tell of it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, after all, not so much to tell&mdash;a schoolgirl
and schoolboy flirtation."  She sighed very prettily as
she spoke.  "I was fourteen, he eighteen."
</p>

<p>
"I knew that you and Captain Morando had met
in Spain, but I did not think it so long ago as that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ten years, ten long years," opening her eyes
in mock seriousness.  "For three years this went
on&mdash;three whole years, then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, please, but some of the physician's
orders are to be carried out at once.  I must send a
peona to see about it.  May I leave you alone again
for a few moments?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, querida, certainly.  The story will keep.
I also have another story of love to tell you.  We shall
be quite sentimental."
</p>

<p>
The girl stepped into the corridor and gave some
orders to a servant.  The young peona wondered
that her mistress's face was stern and her tone
sharp.
</p>

<p>
"Now, señorita mia, time is going, and we will pass
over my own little romance, and I will begin with the
other tale of love."  This from the señora when
Carmelita had returned.  "Are you ready to listen?"
</p>

<p>
The girl so signified.
</p>

<p>
"From speaking of our&mdash;our youthful flirtation&mdash;the
good Captain came to tell me of the grand passion
of his heart."
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, I mean no discourtesy to a guest,
but why do you tell me this?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, my dear, it concerns you most especially.
The other day, in Monterey, Captain Morando and
I were speaking most intimately, as becomes old friends.
What harm?  The Captain confided in me; nay more.
He gave me a message to bring to you.  'I now love
the Señorita Carmelita Mendoza,' he said.  'I pressed
my suit the night of the baile.  At first she listened to
me.  I had heart.  I had courage.  Then she changed.
She flouted me.  Something had offended her, I know
not what.  Will you not see her, the beautiful Carmelita,
and explain to her I meant no harm.  I&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
The señorita sprang to her feet, her breast heaving.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, I cannot listen to you.  Even
though you are a guest of this house, I cannot&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, little child.  Don't be so hasty.  I am
commissioned to set matters right between you two.
Be seated now, my señorita, and hear me to the end.
Please be seated.  I am bungling in my mode of
expression, I know.  Pray be seated."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita took her chair once more.
</p>

<p>
The señora leaned toward her confidingly, her brown
eyes looking straight at the girl, and her voice low
and sweet.
</p>

<p>
"Now, I'll try again, little one.  The Captain said
to me, in effect, that at first the señorita listened to
him the night of the baile; she allowed him to hold
her hand; her eyes dropped.  She&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, I request that this conversation
cease, and that you do not again mention to me
the name of Captain Morando."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear señorita&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I request that you do as I ask, señora."
</p>

<p>
"I can, of course, but do as you wish.  I assure you,
it is not a pleasant task for me to speak of these
matters.  It is only from an urgent desire to serve my
friend who asked this of me.  The other day some one,
in speaking of Captain Morando, said that it is easy
for young men to fall in love; and, indeed, to fall out
of it&mdash;but, away! those threadbare sayings!  The
heart of Don Alfredo is loving and warm.  Do I not
know it?  Had it not been for the dashing Colonel
Valentino&mdash;"  Then suddenly, "O, señorita, a man
cannot forgive everything even in a woman he loves.
If you do not listen to his suit it may be too late, and
you will live to regret, even as I&mdash;"  She stopped,
apparently absorbed in thought of the past.
</p>

<p>
The girl arose.  "Señora Valentino&mdash;" she began.
</p>

<p>
The señora extended her unbandaged hand.  "I have
tried to perform a difficult and a distasteful task.  I
trust some good will come of it.  I will say but one
thing more: Do not trifle too far with Captain Morando."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Morando is nothing to me; nor can he
ever be.  I would not wish it otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"Well, señorita, I have fulfilled my promise.  I have
done my duty.  Shall we now visit the wounded
soldiers?"
</p>

<p>
"If you so desire, Señora Valentino."
</p>

<p>
The two passed out of the house, and across the
courtyard to the hospital department of the Mendoza
hacienda.
</p>

<p>
Five of Captain Morando's men lay on cots in a
large, well-lighted ward.  Señora Valentino went from
one to another making inquiries and speaking words
of encouragement.  One of the men had been in
Morando's company in the North Africa campaigns, and
had taken service again under him in California.
</p>

<p>
"I regret, señora and señorita, that I am disabled,
and cannot be with my Captain in this present
fighting," he said.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt, good man," replied Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"My Captain was the handsomest and the best man
in General Guerrero's division," the soldier went on.
</p>

<p>
"You are loyal," commented the señora.
</p>

<p>
"With good reason.  I have followed him into the
thick of battle.  I have followed him through the
enemy's camp; and," laughing, "I have followed him
when he galloped across country to tinkle his guitar
beneath the window of the beautiful one&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In Spain, or North Africa?" interrupted the
señora jokingly.
</p>

<p>
"I tell no tales out of school," rejoined the man,
continuing the banter.
</p>

<p>
"You interest me, as all soldiers do," from the
señora.  "Are you not one of the picked fighting
men whom your Captain keeps near him for emergencies?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, señora.  The morning Captain Morando was
called from his visit to Colonel Barcelo, in Monterey,
he had made me first sergeant.  Thus I held his horse,
Señora Valentino, while he was within speaking with
you.  You see, I know, kind lady.  Benito, the porter,
told me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, man; remember you are wounded."
</p>

<p>
"Benito told me," the soldier insisted.  "Benito told
me&mdash;" he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! wounded men have strange dreams.  I doubt
not, you have been dreaming."
</p>

<p>
"I think you have talked already as much as the
physician's orders will allow," interposed Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"Of that I am sure," agreed the señora.  "Come,
señorita doña, let us be going.  Now," shaking her
finger at the soldier, "see that your dreams follow a
more orderly fashion."
</p>

<p>
"But," Benito said, "soon the San José Captain
leads our beautiful señora to the padre.  The Captain
rides much beside her&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not another word, Sergeant.  Now, I bid you good
afternoon."
</p>

<p>
She walked toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, señora," called the sergeant, anxiously.
"Benito spoke as if everyone knew already.  Maybe I
wouldn't have presumed to say anything&mdash;leastwise
to yourself&mdash;if that blow on the head the other day
hadn't loosened my tongue as well as my teeth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not another word," from Carmelita, firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita," spoke Señora Valentino, when once more
they were in the courtyard, "fate seems to keep Captain
Morando's name before us."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita did not reply.  The woman and the girl
walked slowly along the broad gravel walk toward the
entrance of the hacienda house.
</p>

<p>
"Our gay and handsome Captain may have lost
his heart and found it a score of times.  Quién sabe?
What would you?  It is the way of men.  But what need
have I to tell a beautiful señorita the way of the
cavalier?"  The señora smiled bewitchingly.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita bit her lip.  Color rose to her face, and
her eyes glowed.  She made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose a cavalier boasts of his conquests when, at
some general meeting of the departmental officers, each
one, made merry by the occasion, has taken a glass or
two of wine above his custom.  What of it?  Was not
my husband, Colonel Valentino, an officer?  A brave
heart he had, and a loving one.  Yet&mdash;"  The señora
laughed.
</p>

<p>
Still no word came from Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"Allow me to say that Captain Morando now loves
you, and you only.  What of the past?  You have his
heart now; and I know he has yours.  Why not?"  Another
bewitching smile.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita continued walking by the señora's side,
not speaking.
</p>

<p>
"If, then, you do not intend to allow the Captain
to continue further his courtship, take his word,
passed by him through me, that he meant no harm."
</p>

<p>
From the walk to the house the girl had adroitly
turned their steps toward the courtyard gate.  Filipo,
the porter, pressed a lever.  The gate swung ajar.
Fifty paces away, comfortably waiting under some
shade trees, were the señora's attendant peons.  At a
word from Filipo they sprang to horse and rode to the
gate in jiglike trot.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Señora Valentino," the girl said, "I shall leave
word with my servants that, if you call again, they
are to announce to you that I am not at home."
</p>

<p>
A peon had brought the señora's horse.  Kneeling
he held the stirrup for her.  Nimbly she found her seat.
The animal pranced gracefully from side to side.
She swung him toward the gate.
</p>

<p>
"Adios!" she called to Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
The señorita's trim, straight figure was disappearing
behind the slowly closing gate.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand thanks, my courteous hostess."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino made her way along the San
José road.  For several hundred yards she rode in
deep thought, a storm of counter currents rushing
over her.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," she reflected, "Morando's course of true
love has not been made more smooth by my visit this
day."  The accompanying laugh was not a mirthful one.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
</h3>

<h3>
A FEW DIPLOMATIC TOUCHES
</h3>

<p>
"Buenos noches, señores."
</p>

<p>
Two men sitting by a fire rose to their feet.
</p>

<p>
"Buenos noches," responded one of them.  The men
moved a little toward the newcomer, one of them
limping considerably, as if injured.
</p>

<p>
"I say," came from the lame man, "perhaps this is
some one our guide has sent in search of us."
</p>

<p>
"We'll soon see," replied the other, in English.  Then
in Spanish: "We are lost here in the forest.  Can you
tell us where we can find food and shelter for the night?"
</p>

<p>
"Of a surety, señor, of a surety," the stranger
replied.  "I am major-domo of Señor Miramonte's
hacienda.  This is his property here.  The señor and his
lady are out, but wayfarer guests are none the less
welcome.  I saw your fire and thought some vagrant
peons had built it.  We greatly dread forest and
pasture fires this time of year.  Come, señors, come
with me."
</p>

<p>
"He offers us the hospitality of a rancho house."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be deuced glad for shelter anywhere," the
injured man replied, both speaking in English.  "I'm at
home on a ship, but riding a stiff-backed horse with
wooden legs is too much for me.  Ugh!  I'm sore as if
I'd been put in a sack and beaten with clubs.  Besides,
I'm actually seasick.  Commodore, think of that!
Sea-sick!  All for riding a jointless, iron-jawed broncho."
</p>

<p>
The man addressed as "Commodore" laughed.
"Maybe riding your horse over that twenty-foot precipice
is a contributary cause to your soreness, Captain."
</p>

<p>
The horseman had dismounted and was carefully
extinguishing the fire, treading on each separate ember
until it was out.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, will you come with me?" he asked,
finally.  "I'll bring you to your own."
</p>

<p>
"What does he say?" asked the one who had been
called "Captain."
</p>

<p>
"He is offering a house after the Spanish custom."
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed!  One of the first things I do when I
get on shipboard will be to learn Spanish."
</p>

<p>
The one riding moved away from the wide-branching
oak, where the fire had been, out toward the open.  It
was bright starlight.
</p>

<p>
"Let the injured one ride my horse.  I will show the
path on foot.  Come.  It is not far to Señor
Miramonte's house."
</p>

<p>
The Commodore interpreted this to his companion.
</p>

<p>
"If it isn't far I'd rather crawl than ride," the
Captain replied.  "Where in the world is the path?  It's
light enough, but I surely do not see any.  Say, is that
fellow an agent for a bandit or something like that?
The pay of an American naval captain is such, you
know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never fear, Hamilton," laughed the Commodore.
"Your pay and mine combined, for a year, would be
hardly more than a bagatelle for one of these
land-and-cattle barons, such as is Miramonte, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"You've been here before?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ten or a dozen years ago.  Rode from Yerba
Buena to San José along a road which I trust must be
near here, though I couldn't find it to-day.  Went from
San José back to San Francisco harbor along the eastern
side of the valley.  Remember, Hamilton, what your
name is for the present?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, I'm plain Smith."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm plain Jones."
</p>

<p>
They followed the man who was leading the horse.
In the open they could see him easily.  In the dense
growths they followed by the sound.  Captain Hamilton
was becoming greatly fatigued when a number of
well-lighted buildings came into view.  Dogs barked and
Indian men and women talked excitedly as the party
approached.
</p>

<p>
A courtyard gate opened wide to receive them.
</p>

<p>
"Behold the bandits' cave, <i>Smith</i>!" said the Commodore.
</p>

<p>
"I see it, <i>Jones</i>," replied the injured man.  "I
declare, it looks good to me.  Will the head bandit
demand that we prove our identity, or something like
that?"
</p>

<p>
"I forgot to tell you that the owner of the premises
is away at present.  The man who brought us here is
major-domo, which might be translated, overseer.  I
fancy he is altogether in charge and will make us as
comfortable as we could wish."
</p>

<p>
The major-domo gave his horse to a peon, then
waved his hand to the front door of the house.  "Gentlemen,
it is as I said before.  What you see is yours.
Enter your own."
</p>

<p>
"I'm willing," agreed Smith when he was told what
had been said.  "A bath and a comfortable bed appeal
to me just now."
</p>

<p>
They were brought to large, airy chambers within.
A hot tub-bath was prepared for Smith; while a peon,
skillful in massaging, kneaded his aching muscles.  The
injury to his knee, sustained in falling, was rather
severe.  The massaging peon bound it tightly with
various poultices of herbs.
</p>

<p>
"I say, man, that's too hot," Smith protested.
</p>

<p>
Jones grinned.  "Perhaps the bandit's servant is
preparing you like a trussed goose."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Commodore&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Jones, my friend."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, <i>Jones</i>.  If this confounded thing were
around your leg, you wouldn't laugh.  You're my
superior officer, and all that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm <i>Jones</i>," the other said, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me Com&mdash;&mdash;I mean, <i>Jones</i>.  Oh!  Ouch! he's
taking those weeds right out of boiling water and tying
them around my smashed knee.  I say, man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Indian paid no attention to his remonstrances
or squirming.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jones!  Where did you get those clothes?"
</p>

<p>
Jones was attired in the regulation house-dress of the
California grandee, from fluted shirt-front to
silver-clasped shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Found them in my room, with a peon valet ready to
assist me into them.  Doubtless you'll be treated the
same way."
</p>

<p>
"Well!  I'll admire myself.  But my bandaged knee
wouldn't fit into such trouserettes as you have on."
</p>

<p>
The bandaging was finished at last.  The peon spoke
to the patient in Spanish.
</p>

<p>
"What is he saying?"
</p>

<p>
"Says for you to go to bed soon.  In the morning
he will remove the bandages, and hopes your knee will
be greatly improved."
</p>

<p>
"Go to bed.  Well, the quarters are sumptuous
enough.  High-posted bed, mahogany bureaus&mdash;one,
two, three of them; and chairs, mahogany too, and
heavy enough for state occasions.  It's all fine, if I only
had a bite of something to eat."
</p>

<p>
The major-domo entered the room, several peons
following him, carrying trays on which were steaming
dishes.
</p>

<p>
Smith was quickly arrayed in a flannel dressing gown.
A table was laid and moved over to his chair.  Savory
meats, vegetables, and fruits were ready.  Wine was
uncorked and placed at the hungry man's hand.
</p>

<p>
The major-domo gave some further orders to the
peons, and then spoke to the traveler who understood
Spanish.  That worthy's eyes twinkled.  "I'm invited
to supper with the family, or the part of it in the house.
I hope you'll enjoy your meal, and have a good rest
to-night.  The Indian surgeon says if necessary he'll
use still hotter and stronger applications to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Smith was comforting himself with the warm meal.
His fellow traveler followed the major-domo along a
corridor, down a short flight of stairs, to a door which
a peon within opened at their approach.  The major-domo
bowed low, and left the man standing at the
door.
</p>

<p>
"In my son's absence I welcome you," said a very
kindly voice.  "I am Señor Miramonte's mother."
</p>

<p>
"I am delighted to greet you, señora."
</p>

<p>
"I regret your companion is injured and unable to
dine with us."
</p>

<p>
"I trust he'll be well to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Señor&mdash;I do not know your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Er-r-Jones."  His face flushed a little.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Jones, I wish to introduce you to my friend,
Señora Valentino, who is also our guest to-night.
Senora Valentino, our esteemed visitor, the Señor
Jones."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino extended her hand to Jones.
"Señor Jones, I am pleased to see you."  A slow,
deliberate smile lit up her features.  "Am glad to meet
you&mdash;here."  Her low bow did not wholly cover the
quizzical look which darted from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
They were ushered into a dining room where a table
generously laid was before them.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino," asked the hostess, "will you not
take the head of the table?"
</p>

<p>
The señora complied.
</p>

<p>
"I am not very strong these days," the elderly lady
explained, "and I am happy that so fair and clever a
hand as Señora Valentino's is here to manage in serving
the dinner."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino presided gracefully.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Jones," she said, with just a hint of emphasis
on 'Jones,' "may I ask if you have been long in Alta
California?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, no.  In fact, only a few days or so."
</p>

<p>
The hour of dinner passed pleasantly.  Places of
interest were spoken of; men and events discussed.  Spain,
France, England, were passed in review.  Señora
Miramontes was European born.  Her husband had been
Spanish ambassador at the great capitals; and the
splendid Miramonte grant in West Santa Clara
Valley was his reward for able service.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty years and more have I been here," she said.
"It was a splendid wilderness when we came; nevertheless,
a wilderness.  We have claimed it for our own,
and now it smiles for us.  The flag of great Spain once
waved over these valleys.  The tread of Spanish friars
hallowed the ground; and God blessed the work of these
men with hundredfold increase.  Then the Mexican
colors replaced those of Spain.  Ah, me!  But Mexico
cares nothing for us; and at heart we are still
Spaniards.  Yes, Spaniards; never Mexicans!"
</p>

<p>
The meal over, the party went to an adjoining
room.  A fire flickered on a vast, old-fashioned hearth.
Candles were not lighted, and the shadows danced
fitfully on the walls and tapestries of the apartment.
</p>

<p>
Señora Miramonte still wished to speak of Europe.
</p>

<p>
"My husband was once ambassador at Saint Petersburg.
We met there a Russian who had been in these
Californias.  He had been in the diplomatic service here
in Monterey, and knew the country well.  Knew it north
and south and east and west.  'Soon Spain loses that
country&mdash;all of it; for Mexico is going,' were his words;
and he was a very shrewd, far-seeing man.  He also
said, 'Then the English and the Americans will come
to blows over the empire that in large part is no man's
land.  Not twenty years,' he would say, 'after Spain
withdraws from North America, not twenty years will
elapse before the British Lion and the American Eagle
will bare the teeth and claws to each other over these
great stretches of wonderful country.'"
</p>

<p>
She paused a moment.
</p>

<p>
"The British Lion has not yet shown his teeth.  He is
ready to do so, just the same.  Do we not know of
Texas, and the country north of us here&mdash;Oregon they
call it?  The American Eagle has not yet cried his
war-scream; yet it is swelling in his throat."
</p>

<p>
"Madam, you speak of great subjects," was Jones's
reply.
</p>

<p>
She nodded, the light now playing uninterruptedly
over her features which were still keen and comely.
"No.  It is my friend, Lomilkovsky, who does the
speaking; and he died sixteen years ago."
</p>

<p>
No one broke the silence for several moments.
</p>

<p>
"I may have spoken too plainly," the venerable lady
went on.  "Rarely has the past opened before me as
to-night.  Spain cannot win; and, I say, let the flag
rule the Pacific Ocean that can."  She arose.  "Señor,
you breakfast with us to-morrow.  Now, please excuse
me, friends.  I must retire.  Early hours compel me.
Señora Valentino, will you kindly act as hostess for the
rest of the evening in my place?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, señora, certainly."
</p>

<p>
The light shone on her snow-white hair as she bowed
her head in final good night.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Señor Jones, the sitting room is pleasant.
Shall we return?" from Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"With all my heart."
</p>

<p>
The Commodore's features were keen and powerful.
Heavy eyebrows stood out across his forehead.  A
strong chin, cleft in the middle, balanced a well-carved
nose.  His lips shut like the jaws of a trap.  His hair,
bushy and dark, glanced grayish in the light.  Withal
a kindly smile seemed rarely absent from his face.  A
martinet on the quarterdeck, off it he was the most
genial of men.
</p>

<p>
"I have not inquired how your friend met his accident,"
from the señora.
</p>

<p>
"We set out at daybreak this morning expecting to
make our destination by night.  In the afternoon
something frightened my friend's horse.  It took the
bit in its teeth, and jumped over the bank of a ravine.
Luckily, there was a pond of water at the bottom.  My
friend was disabled.  The horse escaped despite our
guide's efforts to lasso it.  The guide set out to get
another mount.  Time passed, and he did not return.
I tied my horse, securely, I thought, and climbed a
high hill to get sight of some habitation.  I could see
none.  I returned to find my own horse gone.  Then we
set out on foot to find shelter.  I knew the Camino
Real was somewhere to the east of us.  Our progress
was necessarily slow.  Darkness came.  After wandering
aimlessly for a while we built the fire which the
major-domo saw.  Then," smiling, "the hospitality of
California was offered."
</p>

<p>
"Señor Miramonte will rejoice, I know, when he
learns that Señor Jones and his friend&mdash;the name&mdash;I
did not hear it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My friend's name is Smith."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!&mdash;Smith.  Señor Miramonte will rejoice that
his house could give hospitality to the Señors Jones and
Smith&mdash;unusual names.  No?"  She looked him full in
the eyes, her smile inscrutable.
</p>

<p>
"California's hospitality is proverbial the world
over," was his evasive reply.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! yes.  Ah! yes.  The world over, you say.  I
too have been much about.  May it not be, Señor&mdash;ah!&mdash;Jones,
that we have met before?  Was it, perhaps, in
London three years ago, or, even in your capital,
Washington, two years past?"
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, let me say, once having seen you
no man could forget you.  It was in Washington, also
in London; and, before that, in Vienna, that I had the
pleasure of knowing you."
</p>

<p>
"And the Señor Smith, your companion?" smilingly.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, I cry a truce of this.  I am Commodore
Billings, of the American navy.  The man with me is
Captain Hamilton, of my flagship.  For the present
neither of us cares to be thus known."
</p>

<p>
The woman arched her eyebrows.  "That is entirely
the affair of the Señor Commodore and the Señor
Capitan.  Still, why so far from the flagship?"
</p>

<p>
"We were riding incognito through a peaceful and
friendly land, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Rumors float about, Señor Officer."
</p>

<p>
The man looked into the fire for a moment.  "Señora
Valentino, I have told you who I am.  I will tell you
also that I am in command of the Pacific squadron of
the American navy.  Will you be as candid with me,
and tell me why you are in this country?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "You haven't yet told me why you are
traveling under an assumed name; neither, why you
are on the mainland of California."
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly for diversion, señora."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Señor Commodore, it is as our hostess said,
is it not so? that the Lion and the Eagle are straining
to the contest over spoils vast as the territory of all
Europe.  Come, let us be fair with each other.  You
are here in the interest of the United States.  Some
special errand leads you on a secret journey.  An
accident brings you and me under the same roof; and fate,
perhaps, leaves us here alone together in conversation.
It may be that you and I could come to some understanding
about affairs of mighty interest.  Indeed, it
may be, save two nations from grave misunderstanding."
</p>

<p>
His smile was as genial as ever, as he said: "The
señora favors Great Britain in the dispute she alleges
may some time arise.  Am I not correct?"
</p>

<p>
She bowed.  "You met the Señor O'Donnell a week
ago, and again four days ago.  Was it at your last
meeting he told you of my preferences, or at the
first?"  She laughed, and playfully tapped the Commodore's
hand with her fan.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, may I say to you that I have letters in my
possession from our State Department, in Washington,
which relate not only to your presence here but which
also tell something of your work as England's secret
agent in Alta California."
</p>

<p>
Again the woman laughed.  "Child's play, Commodore!
Child's play!  The man who sent this information
to your State Department, in Washington, is here,
and in touch with you.  Certainly, he told you as much
as he wrote to Washington."
</p>

<p>
The officer made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Commodore Billings, I deal with you, and with you
only.  I take not account of the frontiersman, O'Donnell.
The United States, though still young, is a great
nation; and should be represented by men such as you."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, O'Donnell has the confidence of Mr. Tyler,
President of the United States."
</p>

<p>
"Has your Mr. Tyler the confidence of the republic
which made him its President?"
</p>

<p>
There was no reply.
</p>

<p>
The señora arose.  The jewels in her hair flamed and
glittered in the firelight.  A hundred questions seemed
to burn in the depths of her eyes.  She extended her
hand, as if in gesture.  The warrior-diplomat was
impelled to arise also, and to take the hand in his.
</p>

<p>
"Señor the Commodore, you go to conference with
Mendoza, of Mission San José.  Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
He started to reply, but checked himself.
</p>

<p>
"Think on what you do.  We of this province&mdash;Mendoza
and a handful of others excepted&mdash;desire not to
be ruled by your nation."
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, I am but a student of conditions
here."
</p>

<p>
She moved closer toward him.  He still held her hand.
</p>

<p>
"You do not come with prejudged verdict?"  In her
earnestness she placed her disengaged hand on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly not.  Of course I know the general desire
of my government.  Further than that I do what
seems wisest."
</p>

<p>
"Then consult the people of California.  See Padre
Osuna, that saintly Chrysostom of this Western world.
Meet Colonel Barcelo, the acting-governor.  Interview
Pio Pico, and his brother Andreas.  See the Peraltas,
the Carillos.  Señor Mendoza represents but few
besides himself."
</p>

<p>
She moved away from him.  "As to this
O'Donnell&mdash;O'Donnell!  He is a man with a price on his head,
placed there by the English government.  What wonder
he intrigues against England!"
</p>

<p>
"Some political offense, of course."
</p>

<p>
"For attempted murder!  He struck down his
captain on the parade ground in Dublin, following an
admonition."
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, madam!"
</p>

<p>
"This would-be assassin carries word to you from
Señor Mendoza&mdash;why does he forget he is Colonel
Mendoza?&mdash;carries word that Mendoza has wishes for
the department of California which differ from the
wishes of the people themselves who comprise this
department.  Indeed!  And who is this Mendoza?  Is
he not of a make-up so unrestrained that once, in a
burst of temper, he even burned to the ground his
magnificent home?  Ask the people of California if this is
not true.  Bethink you, my Commodore."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, I ask you, what is in the wind?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us be seated, Señor Commodore."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him intently.  "Texas is free from
Mexico.  Some of your States wish to accept the
republic of Texas as one of themselves.  The States north
of the Mason and Dixon line object.  They oppose
extension of Negro slavery.  Your President Tyler is on
the fence, dangling his long legs in the air, prepared
to jump to either side, as it seems expedient for him."
</p>

<p>
The Commodore covered his mouth with his hand, to
conceal an involuntary smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oregon is now jointly held by the United States
and England.  Some of your States wish for a part of
Oregon.  Others make opposition; and the opposition
this time comes from those south of the Mason and
Dixon line.  The reason?  No possibility of slavery
in Oregon.  Your President, from his perch, dangles
his long legs yet more alertly."
</p>

<p>
Billings now laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, you are droll."
</p>

<p>
"Is what I say not true, my Commodore?"
</p>

<p>
"Oregon is ours, my lady, by occupation.  Doctor
Whitman and his missionaries live in that country;
are Christianizing the Indians, and drawing settlers
from beyond the Mississippi.  Oregon is ours, I say,
by right of occupation."
</p>

<p>
"A hundred years before your Whitman saw light
missionaries from French Canada lived among those
same tribes.  England succeeded to the rights of France.
Oregon, then, is England's by this right of occupation
of which you speak."
</p>

<p>
"But, the rifles of the American settlers in Oregon!
They will speak, and speak strongly, my lady."
</p>

<p>
"But the rifles of the Spanish hacenderos in California,
my Commodore!  Can they not speak?  Commodore
Billings, a shot in California will echo around the
world!"
</p>

<p>
She leaned toward him and placed her hand on the
arm of his chair.  "A few months ago I saw Doctor
McLoughlin, head of the Hudson Bay Company, at
Vancouver.  He knows of the work of your missionary
Whitman.  My Commodore, twenty British ships-of-war
are in the Pacific waters.  I saw them, one and
all, on my journey to the North.  They are not far
from here."
</p>

<p>
"So many, Señora Valentino?"
</p>

<p>
"That many."
</p>

<p>
"I did not think Admiral Fairbanks&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She waited for him to continue.  As he did not she
went on:
</p>

<p>
"That enthusiast, Mendoza, thinks he can persuade
you to seize our capital, Monterey.  Suppose you do?
The province will seethe in rebellion, and call to
Admiral Fairbanks for aid.  He will give it.  That means
war.  Your United States is unprepared for war at
sea.  Mexico then goes under an English protectorate.
Texas goes back to Mexico, and England will then
control the Pacific Coast from the tropics to the Russian
line in the far north."
</p>

<p>
Both were standing now.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, neither Mendoza, nor anyone,
can lead me into an unconsidered move in this matter."
</p>

<p>
"To-night you had an appointment with Mendoza.
Fate intervened.  To-morrow sees not the danger
removed.  He will ask you to seize this province for the
United States.  Commodore Billings, ruin comes if you
do."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, I have never seen Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"You know of his wishes.  Others do."
</p>

<p>
"But I shall judge for myself."
</p>

<p>
Again her inscrutable smile.  "Commodore, I thank
you.  I mean&mdash;that is to say&mdash;I thank you for listening
to me to-night.  I pray good will come of it."  Her
hand was on his arm.  He took it in fervent grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, Europe knows you for a brilliant woman.
I say you are that, and more.  I am glad to have met
you again."  He looked at his watch.  "It is late.  I
fear I have kept you too long.  I ask your pardon."
</p>

<p>
"My Commodore, have a care, only, that you do not
ask pardon of the world one day for what your decision
to-morrow may bring about."
</p>

<p>
"Your words do you honor, señora.  May I ask leave
now to retire?"
</p>

<p>
"The leave is yours, Commodore."
</p>

<p>
After good night had been said Señora Valentino
returned to her chair by the fire.  Into the flames she
looked for a long time.
</p>

<p>
"The Commodore talks in his silence," she finally
said to herself, smiling grimly.  "The pages of this
drama fast turn themselves&mdash;very fast&mdash;to the issue.
'But I shall judge for myself.'  Ah!  Commodore, your
silence is indeed golden.  So, Mendoza wishes you to
seize Monterey&mdash;evidently&mdash;but, 'you will judge for
yourself.'  Discreet Commodore!  But we shall see&mdash;we
shall see!"
</p>

<p>
The thick oaken log in the fireplace was ashes before
the señora went to her room.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br />
ALMOST&mdash;&mdash;
</h3>

<p>
Señora Valentino rode slowly along the way
leading from Santa Clara to Pueblo San José.
Willow trees lined the edge of the road, lifting their
featherly foliage in greeting to the morning sun.
Yellow light filtered through and marked the interlacing
plumes with myriad fairy figures in golden tints.  The
branches nodded and undulated in low-toned rhythm.
Tempered breezes from the bay, sweet with the breath
of virgin meadow, hung light-winged over this shaded
alameda.  Peons, men and women, worked in the
vegetable gardens by the wayside, singing as they labored.
Betimes they used the guttural words of their aborigine
tongue, the age-old longing of savage man flowing in
heavy note and shrill refrain.  Again, some neophyte
rested for the moment on hoe or mattock and intoned
a hymn.  Then knoll and hollow resounded as the
children of the wilderness sang the words of their
new-found faith.
</p>

<p>
The long white line marking the fort at San José had
come plainly into view when the señora halted.
</p>

<p>
"My message requested the Captain to meet me here
at this hour," she said to no one in particular.  Her
mounted Indian guard was a score of paces behind.
Just then Captain Farquharson, coming at swift
gallop, turned the bend just ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning!" she called to him.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning!" he called back.  "Well, the great
question," as he drew up at her side.  "Your word
reached me after midnight.  Our signal-fire was lighted
within two hours, on the high mountains east of San
José.  This morning at daylight the signal-smoke told
me that Admiral Fairbanks's anchors are under weigh
for Monterey harbor.  Now, your note told me nothing
of the particulars of your interview with Billings last
night.  You managed to gain his attention, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"I did.  But our English admiral?  Tell me, is he
of two minds, as he was the other day; or have they
crystallized into one?"
</p>

<p>
"He has agreed to keep his fleet hidden until our
signal-fire or smoke informs him it is the hour to enter
Monterey harbor and take possession."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that is his mind now."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, I await with great interest some news of
your interview last night with the American.  He must
have said something of deep import that you sent word
to signal at once our admiral's fleet.  Fairbanks reaches
Monterey easily to-morrow.  What I signal him to do
there, and how soon, will be greatly determined by what
you learned last night from this Billings."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain, since nothing is to be done until
to-morrow, you have time to answer me a question or
two."  The lady laughed, then went on: "How did you manage
to get our gringo naval heroes lost at the right time
yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
"Simple, very simple, indeed.  They lost themselves.
One hero's saddle seat was uncertain.  He gripped his
horse with his calves, to make himself more secure,
forgetting the sharp spurs on his heels.  The indignant
broncho jumped over the nearest bank, his rider just
naturally following.  I declare, the gallant officer
actually spun head over heels twice before he landed in
the water.  The peon with the two gentlemen was held
by our men under pretended suspicion of being a
runaway, when he went in search of another horse.  This
left our heroes without a guide; and Valeriano, the
Miramonte major-domo, did his part when the stars
began to shine.  Now, señora, of course Commodore
Billings&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She interrupted him.  "If the gringo hero's horse
had not obligingly jumped over that bank, how would
you have got the Commodore to Señor Miramonte's
hacienda house at the right time?"
</p>

<p>
"Depend on it, I would have found a way.  Bringing
them to the Miramonte's place as suspicious characters
would have been the last resort.  You would have identified
the Commodore, in that case, and would have made
all possible amends for unwarranted detention."
</p>

<p>
"Of course."  The two joined their laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Mendoza's peons were scouring the woods last night
for the officers.  Our fellows furnished them plenty
of information.  It didn't lead them to Miramonte's
house, you may be sure."  Again the forest echoed the
sound of their laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Well," from the señora, "our two worthies set out
comfortably enough this morning, after early breakfast
with us.  Alberto, the Miramonte's peon, guides them
to Señor Mendoza.  Alberto," lifting her eyebrows,
"understands English.  When a lad, a religious-minded
gringo tallow-trader captain took him to Boston, and
had him educated, hoping he would become a missionary
here of the tallow-trader's faith.  Instead he reverted
to the ordinary peon, and an ardent Americano hater,
into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"Fortunately for us.  It was simply invaluable that
he was present the other day at that Billings-O'Donnell
talk at Half Moon bay, and thus found out about the
appointment to meet at Mendoza's last night.  But,"
laughing a little, yet serious, "I'm anxious as to what
happened last night at Miramonte's."
</p>

<p>
"Just one more question, Captain.  In what frame
of mind was Padre Osuna when you last saw him?"
</p>

<p>
"You have swung him to our side, señora, for the
second time.  But he forced from Fairbanks and me
papers giving these natives extraordinary rights when
the country is ours."
</p>

<p>
"The padre is where now, do you judge?"
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere near San Luis Obispo.  He travels like
the whirlwind.  Yesterday he swept the crowd off its
feet when he spoke from the church steps at Monterey.
They cheered and stormed for English rule.  His discourse
over, he set off for the south with the impetuosity
of a crusader."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my Captain, we have done our part.  It
remains for Fairbanks to do his."
</p>

<p>
"Now, señora, why was it you sent the hurried
messenger last night?  What did Billings say that you
thought such haste necessary?"
</p>

<p>
"Practically nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon, señora.  You must have misunderstood
me.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I understood you perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, señora, think of your reply."
</p>

<p>
"My reply was that Commodore Billings said practically
nothing from which I thought haste necessary.
It was from what he palpably refrained from saying
that I made my inference."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson drew his bridle-rein.  His horse curveted
over the turf, under pressure of the curb-bit.
He drew the animal back to the woman's side.  "Señora
Valentino, what does Billings intend to do?"
</p>

<p>
"To seize Monterey for the United States if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If what?"
</p>

<p>
"If he can find reasonable excuse, in the attitude of
the hacenderos here, for such a move."
</p>

<p>
"But can he?"
</p>

<p>
"He can, if Colonel Mendoza is minded to supply it."
</p>

<p>
"But, señora, at the Mendoza baile the entire
countryside cried out for an English protectorate."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but we made the minds of these men for them.
The structure may not be the most lasting."
</p>

<p>
"But, perdition! they&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Admiral Fairbanks must seize Monterey as soon as
he reaches there," she went on.
</p>

<p>
"He must!  By heaven he must!  I'll ruin him before
all England if he flinches."
</p>

<p>
"Remember, Captain, Commodore Billings will fight."
</p>

<p>
"My word, señora!  Fight us!  Why, bless my soul! our
fleet outnumbers him at least three to one.
Fairbanks could sink him in an hour."
</p>

<p>
The woman leaned in her saddle toward the officer.
"I shall be in Monterey all day to-morrow.  So must
you, Captain."
</p>

<p>
They shook hands over the manes of their horses
and parted company, the Captain riding swiftly across
the fields, the lady walking her mount toward San
José.
</p>

<p>
The adobe walls of the fort were a dozen feet or so
in height, with eaves projecting outward, the better to
prevent scaling by a possible enemy.  Within these walls
was a row of buildings in which were the officers of the
alcalde, the subprefect, the jefe-politico and other civil
officers of the pueblo.  Here also were the quarters of
Morando's men.  The Captain himself had a reception
room in one corner of an edifice facing the street.  A
motley gathering was in this room, also clustered
around the door as the Señora Valentino drew rein.  Her
mounted escort had drawn up on either side of her in
orderly lines, each peon so tightening his bridle that the
horses walked in perfect step.
</p>

<p>
Captain Morando, the comandante, pushed his way
through the crowd to the lady's side.  "Thrice glad am
I to see you, amiga mia.  Will you not alight and rest
awhile?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Captain."
</p>

<p>
He released her foot from the stirrup and assisted
her to the ground.
</p>

<p>
"My poor place shines like the morning in answer to
your presence, señora."
</p>

<p>
She smiled on him and looked about over the waiting
crowd.  "Why so many sad faces here, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"These friends mourn relatives who fell in the recent
contest with Yoscolo.  To-day the Department, through
me, considers the demands for pensions."
</p>

<p>
"Then I interrupt."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed not, my friend.  This reception room meets
never a guest more welcome than Señora Valentino."
</p>

<p>
"But these sad ones?  You must not neglect them for
my sake."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not forget you, nor neglect them.  Besides,
my work with the pensioners has about concluded."
</p>

<p>
The peonas had nearly all dried their tears, had
gathered their restless pocos niños together and were
preparing to depart, with many blessings murmured on
the "very good and very handsome comandante."
</p>

<p>
The señora seated near the Captain was greatly
interested in the scene.  "Their praises for you, señor,
are fervent, if not loud," she remarked.
</p>

<p>
Soon the man and woman were alone in the reception
room.  She regarded him gravely.  He started from a
revery and caught her look.  He flushed.  She laughed
a little.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain, I have done as you requested."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"I have seen the Señorita Mendoza and have told her
for you that&mdash;&mdash;"  She paused.
</p>

<p>
He waited for her to continue.
</p>

<p>
"I must say I do not quite understand the girl,
charming, indeed, as she is."
</p>

<p>
"How so, señora?"
</p>

<p>
"O, friend of my heart, I would spare you pain."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me everything, señora."
</p>

<p>
"O, Don Alfredo, everything?  My heart fails me.
How can I wound you?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not fear for me, gentle one.  Let me know the
truth.  Please go on."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;if I must.  I made occasion to do your bidding
by visiting the Mendoza house, ostensibly to express
to the host of the great baile at Mission San José
my appreciation of that event.  The señor was away,
but his daughter received me.  This was just the
opportunity I would have wished for.  Nothing could have
been better for our purpose, Don Alfredo."
</p>

<p>
He bowed in recognition of the fact.
</p>

<p>
"We passed bits of conversation from one to the
other on chance topics.  The young lady was delightful.
As we sat in the cool drawing room sipping tea and
nibbling dulces I thought continually of you, my friend.
Small wonder, truly, that you wished to wed this
beautiful and talented young woman.  Small wonder, again,
that the swains of the valley lay their hearts before her,
as she beckons."
</p>

<p>
The soldier's face grew gloomy.
</p>

<p>
"When our time had in a measure sped I introduced
the subject on which you wished me to speak with her."
</p>

<p>
"How did she receive it?"
</p>

<p>
"I am puzzled to know how to explain.  It is but a
step, often, from joy to sorrow; at times, discourtesy
seems waiting on the threshold of courtesy.  Well,
enough to say that our pleasant relations underwent a
change most unaccountable.  The Doña Carmelita
grew cold and drew within herself.  Try as I might I
could not bring back the former cordiality.  In the
course of the conversation I said: 'Señorita, Captain
Morando loves you and you only.'  She replied: 'Señora
Valentino, I cannot listen to you; even though you are
a guest in this house I cannot.'
</p>

<p>
"We parleyed further.  She was obdurate.  She tried
to cut me short with the words: 'I request that this
conversation cease and that you do not again mention to
me the name of Captain Morando.'
</p>

<p>
"Yet still did I refuse to accept her dismissal of the
subject.  You see, my one-time knight, I was determined
to fulfill your wishes, no matter what came."
</p>

<p>
She lowered her eyes with a tender little sigh, but
went on hastily.  "I continued to speak of you and of
your love for her.  She almost flung at me: 'Captain
Morando is nothing to me, nor can he ever be.  I would
not wish it otherwise.'
</p>

<p>
"Then I concluded: 'At least accept his word that he
meant no harm by his attentions to you.'  To this she
gave no response.
</p>

<p>
"We were now at the hacienda gate.  She summoned
the peon who had my horse in charge.  As I mounted
she said: 'Remember, if you call again, I shall give word
to my maid to tell you I am not at home.'"
</p>

<p>
The young man came to her side and took her hand
in both his.  "Forgive me, señora.  Forgive me, my dear
friend, the stupid selfishness in asking you to do such an
errand.  When I think of your goodness to me and of
my placid acceptance of it I curse myself for a
brute."
</p>

<p>
"You are harsh with yourself, Alfredo," putting her
disengaged hand on his.
</p>

<p>
"No, señora, a thousand times, no.  How can I ever
atone for my thoughtlessness!"
</p>

<p>
The lustrous brown eyes were looking gently at him.
He gazed into their beautiful depths.  She leaned a
trifle nearer.
</p>

<p>
He continued: "I have been a cur!  You have suffered
your life long.  You generously gave me the confidences
of your heart.  I saw how empty your years have been
of the things that, after all, really count in this world;
yet I, selfish fool! could only whine about my own loss."
</p>

<p>
"Don't, don't, Alfredo.  You must not say such words."
</p>

<p>
"Dear amiga, you are too forgetful of yourself,
always thinking of the good you may do others.  You
have a claim on me, a strong claim, which I shall always
remember; for, no matter how unwitting on my part,
unhappiness came to you years ago, and that unhappiness
still persists.  Added to this, I have been the direct
cause of your losing your friend, the Doña Carmelita.
I wish I could make compensation."
</p>

<p>
The woman's eyes drooped.  Her hands fell to her
side.
</p>

<p>
"The past is gone&mdash;gone the way of all past things,"
she said, very slowly.
</p>

<p>
"But the hurt continues," he returned.
</p>

<p>
"You certainly cannot blame yourself for that."
</p>

<p>
He dropped on his knees beside her.  "My dear
señora, my true friend, ask what you will of me, and if
I can accomplish it, it shall be yours.  I would do
anything to be of service to you."
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes and put her hand on his shoulder.
"Alfredo, how could you retrieve a broken life?  Why,
I envy the love of the peonas for their husbands who fell
by your side at La Cuesta de los Gatos.  Though bereft
their love lives on.  Their heart is not empty, as is
mine&mdash;as is mine.  Ah, me!"
</p>

<p>
"Doña Silvia, the way of love should not be difficult
to one of your gentle spirit.  Surely, you will find it,
with all the joys bordering thereon."
</p>

<p>
Her eyebrows lifted almost imperceptibly.  She moved
a little away.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me," he said anxiously, noting the
movement.  "I have entered forbidden ground."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, dear Alfredo.  For you it is not forbidden
ground.  There is not a recess within my heart where
you might not enter."
</p>

<p>
"You are more than kind, my good friend."
</p>

<p>
"Friend!  Captain," showing some impatience,
"friend!  Good friend!"  She tried to hide the sarcasm
in her tone by an unusually alluring smile.  "I am but
one of your many, many good friends.  Is it not so?"
her voice sounding hard in spite of herself.  "O, well, I
must be content with whatever the gods see fit to bestow."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, you are not merely one of many.  You are
my most loyal, my warmest, my ever-remaining,
ever-to-be-cherished, never-to-be-forgotten&mdash;&mdash;"  He paused,
overcome by his own vehemence.
</p>

<p>
"You would scale barbed walls to carry away the
señorita of the window pane," leaning wearily on her
arm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear Silvia, I would scale those walls," he went
on, passionately.  "I would scale them and bear you
away," taking both her hands.  Her warm breath was
against his cheek.  "I would&mdash;I would&mdash;&mdash;"  His voice
choked.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;Even sing love songs outside the window, to the
accompaniment of the guitar.  O, Alfredo!"
</p>

<p>
In space of time hardly more than an instant he saw
the Señorita Carmelita's eyes flash behind the barred
window; heard her gay banter at the house party; felt
her soft hand in his as he had spoken love to her at the
baile.
</p>

<p>
Very gently he moved away from the señora.  Slowly
he arose to his feet.  The woman quickly realized the
effect of her ill-chosen words.  She arose also and stood
leaning on the back of her chair.  For a moment they
looked at each other.  She was the first to speak, a
queer little smile stealing over her face.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain Morando, I have made report to
you," the smile vanishing.  "I must now&mdash;journey
homeward."
</p>

<p>
He escorted the señora to her horse.  Assisting her
to mount he kissed her hand in parting salute.
</p>

<p>
She rode leisurely out of the pueblo, pleasantly
exchanging greetings with acquaintances along the way.
Once on the plains, however, she lashed her horse until
the beast plunged and kicked in fury.  She quelled him
with bit and word, then rode at break-neck speed until
he was winded.
</p>

<p>
The peon guard followed in wonderment.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br />
PEDRO ZELAYA BRINGS IMPORTANT NEWS
</h3>

<p>
"On with the green boughs, Anselmo.  Now, you,
Francisco, the turpentine in plenty.
Pronto! hombre.  Pronto!  Hasten!  Diablo!"
</p>

<p>
The wind from the Yerba Buena side blew more and
more strongly, and finally stiffened to a quarter gale.
</p>

<p>
"It is useless, Señor Zelaya," said the peon Anselmo.
"The breeze from the bay so fans the blaze that there
is no smoke at all, but all flame."
</p>

<p>
Don Pedro Zelaya and his peons were on a pinnacle
of one of the high hills which skirt the eastern side of
San Francisco harbor.  Away at the south somewhere
was the hacienda of Mendoza.  On the roof of
Mendoza's hacienda house by night and by day watchers
scanned the north horizon for fire or smoke signals
telling that the British fleet had sailed, and announcing,
in the devious ways known to such signal-makers, the
direction the ships had taken, together with other apt
information.
</p>

<p>
"Caramba!  Caramba!" stormed little Zelaya.  "Bring
more green leaves.  Give over using that turpentine
now.  Perhaps we'll get some smoke after all."
</p>

<p>
The keen air breathed through the heaping leaves
with a bellowslike sound.  The fierce heat exuded the oil
from the fiber and the flames roared with added vigor.
</p>

<p>
"Bring water!" commanded Zelaya.  "We must have
a signal-smoke here, or it means a wild dash on
horseback to Mission San José.  Bring water, I say."
</p>

<p>
"There is no water within a league, Señor Zelaya.
Besides, the high wind would blow the smoke along the
mountain top, not letting it form a column that would
reach upward."
</p>

<p>
The excitable Zelaya ran to his horse tied to some
brush near by.  Taking his canteen from the saddle he
poured the contents, a quart or so of water, on the
blazing fire.  There was a splutter, a sizzle, and the
leaves burned as furiously as before.
</p>

<p>
The sun was just peeping over the eastern horizon.
Zelaya looked intently, listening expectantly.  When
the wind lulled for a moment there came swelling over
the hills the reenforced bellowings from tens of
thousands of cattle throats.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the herds are at last coming in from the San
Joaquin bottoms.  Well, we have other fish to fry
besides thinking of that.  Say! you, Anselmo, and you,
Francisco, are you sure you caught all the signals
right?  No danger of mistake?  Are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
The small black eyes of the peons glittered.  "We
wish we were as sure of heaven, Señor Zelaya.  Our
men saw the signal fire on the high mountains east of
San José last night; saw the answer on Tamalpais.
This morning at daybreak they saw the great white
birds swim out in the direction of the south wind.  Our
young master, Roberto Morago, said that only cannon
and heaps of cannon balls were on the decks.  He saw
it through his field glass from his station on the flank
of Mount Diablo.  We have brought you his word,
Señor Zelaya, and our telling is true.  It's no use; we
cannot send a smoke signal in this wind."
</p>

<p>
Zelaya was already astride his mount.  "It means a
couple of hours' delay," he muttered, "a couple of hours
which we can in no way afford."
</p>

<p>
He rode his horse furiously.  The wind sang in his
ears as he swept along.  His face was set and hard, his
eyes narrowing to burning sparks.
</p>

<p>
"So, the English ships have sailed southward, with
decks cleared for action!" he thought.  "Word must be
given to Mendoza and the American commodore at
once."  Then with an oath: "What misfortune this
strong wind was blowing on this of all mornings!  Well,
I'll get to Mission San José with the news if my horse
holds out! or," he half laughed, "if he fails, I'll lasso a
bull and press him into service."
</p>

<p>
The horseman slipped down the steep grades, passed
the rancho of his neighbor, Señor Peralta; rode through
the foothills comprising part of the grant of Don Luis
Castro, and into the confines of his own property, the
Rancho Arroyo San Lorenzo.  Here he reined in for a
moment, and allowed the animal to lope, an easy canter
much affected in early-California days.
</p>

<p>
"Now, for Arroyo Seco, Mendoza's outpost!  I'll
find a fresh horse there in his corrals."
</p>

<p>
He spurred his horse which dashed along the foothills
toward Mission San José.  The bellowing of the returning
cattle became plainer and plainer.  The vanguard
of the herds was already dotting the higher levels above
him.
</p>

<p>
"Caramba!  I'm none too far away, if I wish to avoid
being caught in the press."
</p>

<p>
With word and quirt and spur he urged his horse
forward.  Mile after mile sped past.
</p>

<p>
"You, poor fellow, are pretty well done," to his
animal as it labored along.  "Well, I see Mendoza's
corrals ahead.  I'll leave you there in good hands, and
get my saddle on another racer."
</p>

<p>
Many cattle and horses in the marshes adjacent on
the bay had not been rounded up in the spring when
the droves had been formed for the San Joaquin.  They
had swum across the intervening sloughs to the salt-grass
pastures where fodder was more plentiful.  After
the rains had come these animals had returned to the
valley lands and had grown fat.
</p>

<p>
Each stallion is a general having under him his
lieutenants who, with him, form a guard for the protection
of the mothers and foals of the family.  As it is with
the horse so is it with the cattle.  The cows and calves
follow the mighty leaders that afford them safety.
</p>

<p>
Thus, from the valley came hundreds of horses and
cattle to meet the homecomers.  They had scented their
fellows from afar, and flew madly to the foothills, to do
them battle.  The vaqueros were miles away, in the rear
of the swarming, home-coming herds.  In time they
would make peace by clubbing the fighting leaders over
nose or horn with their heavy whip-stocks.
</p>

<p>
Zelaya was within half a mile of the Mendoza corral
when a drove of fifty or more horses, led by a splendid
dapple-gray stallion, came thundering from a deep
hollow directly in front of him.  The leader disdained
battle with a single stranger and rushed by like the
wind.  Don Pedro turned rein and ran with the drove
for safety.  Little by little he lessened speed; then, as
the way opened, he left the company forced on him
and again turned toward the Mendoza corrals.
</p>

<p>
A hundred paces to the side a herd of cattle, led by
an immense bull, was charging in the foothills.  The
leader saw the horseman and made for him viciously.
The Spaniard waved his reata and shouted, "Hoop-la!
Hoop-la!" after the manner of the vaquero.  The herd
paused, snorted; then, with head and tail up, looked on
while their protector fought the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The bull lowered its head and rushed at him, roaring
a tremendous bass defiance.  The Spaniard swung his
horse to one side, and the beast stumbled past him.
Again and again was this repeated.  Finally, the horse
stepped into a hole and fell.  The rider came to the
ground on his feet, moved quickly aside, in time to avoid
a furious rush from the tormentor.  As the bull stopped
in preparation for another attack Don Pedro sprang
on its back.
</p>

<p>
"I have for myself a merienda," he thought, grimly,
remembering the day when he had ridden the bull at the
Calaveras picnic ground.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, run to the corral, my lordly beast!"
</p>

<p>
The animal ran around and around in a circle, roaring
terrifically.
</p>

<p>
"Carrajo!  Carrajo! 'twill not do," called the rider.
"I must make the corral.  Go, now, you son of an imp!
Run as I direct!"
</p>

<p>
Climbing out well on the shoulders he managed to
reach the beast's nose with his spur.  First kicking it
on one side of the muzzle, then on the other, he
succeeded in getting it started toward the corral.
</p>

<p>
"Grande!  Grande!" he shouted.  "You make not badly
the mount.  Hoop-la!  Hoop-la!  Pronto!  Pronto!"
</p>

<p>
The bull ran under some trees, endeavoring to free
itself from the incumbrance.  Zelaya drew himself up
into the branches.
</p>

<p>
"It is again the merienda, as I have said.  Now, farewell,
toro mio, I go to the corral and stables for a mount
superior even to you."
</p>

<p>
The bull hurried back to his bellowing herd, and soon
together they were tearing onward to the hills, to fight
the myriad homecomers.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand and one devils!  A thousand and one
devils!" exclaimed Zelaya a few moments later.  The
corrals and stables were empty.  The peon cots were
vacant.  Evidently, Mendoza had sent all available
horses and men to the San Joaquin to bring home his
grazing stock.
</p>

<p>
The little man did not hesitate.  Off came his
embroidered jacket, his outer, as well as his inner, shirt,
then his long riding boots.  He tossed his sombrero,
heavy with gold, to one side.
</p>

<p>
"Behold! 'twould not be so bad, if I only had my
running shoes."
</p>

<p>
The morning sun fell on his muscular torso, the runner's
flat abdomen and well-sinewed limbs discernible
through the knee-pants and leggings.
</p>

<p>
For an instant he pulled his short mustachios savagely.
"I may meet more bulls and their families, and
I have now no spurs," glancing at his discarded boots.
"Well, if a bull chases me toward Mission San José I
shall reach my goal all the quicker."
</p>

<p>
It was three leagues good, as the bird flies, to the
Mendoza hacienda house, at the Mission.  Don Pedro
set off across country at a long, swinging gait which
ate the miles like fire.  For nearly a league he ran along
cattle paths in the tall oats and drying mustard.  Then
he struck the main-traveled road.  Here he rested for
a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Diablo!" standing first on one foot, then on the
other.  "That dried grass has the edge of a knife!"
</p>

<p>
The roaring of cattle and the raucous threatening
of a stallion sent him flying along instantly.
</p>

<p>
"A pest on it!  I prefer the sharp grass edge to these
infernal stones," the ragged pebbles in the road bruising
and tearing his feet, while the dry grass had cut cleanly.
Still he did not waver.  Bright red spots showed on his
cheeks; his breath came in quick gasps, but he did not
slacken the wonderful pace he had set for himself.
</p>

<p>
Once a bull compelled him to climb a tree, and once
he hid under a bank while a stallion led his squadron
past.  "I take the rest whether or no I need it," was
his laconic thought at these times.
</p>

<p>
Finally he came in sight of the towers of Mendoza's
house.  It was yet a league away, and more.  Don
Pedro tightened his belt, looked at his bleeding feet,
then at the mansion gleaming white in the sun.  He
surveyed the landscape in search of a horseman, but in
vain.
</p>

<p>
He bathed his feet in a streamlet, then darted along
the rough road at a speed that might, indeed, be fitly
described as only less than that of a fast-galloping
horse.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*******
<br />
</p>

<p>
"Commodore Billings, float the stars and stripes over
Monterey before another sun goes out!"
</p>

<p>
In the Administrator's sitting room were gathered
Billings, Hamilton, O'Donnell, and a score of land
barons of the valley.
</p>

<p>
The American's mouth shut in a straight line.  "You
Spaniards, save a handful, are clamoring for English
rule.  Still, Señor Mendoza, you ask me to invest the
capital of this province with my ships.  To what end?"
</p>

<p>
"To afford our California opportunity to appeal
from her inconsiderate self to her wiser self."
</p>

<p>
"Mendoza, I represent the United States.  My office
is to conserve, or advance, her interests."
</p>

<p>
"Señor Commodore, California is the key to the vast
region north and east.  With this province goes mastery
of the Pacific from the Isthmus to the ice.  No small
addition to the United States of America."
</p>

<p>
"California, in her wiser thought, you intimate, would
elect to become a province under my government.  I so
understand you, señor."
</p>

<p>
The Administrator nodded affirmatively.
</p>

<p>
"I am, then, to hold your capital pending this
expected change of attitude?"
</p>

<p>
Again the affirmation from Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, our Señor Hacendado, suppose the inevitable
finds resting place on the other horn of this
dilemma, and your province elects to become British?"
</p>

<p>
Several of the men were on their feet, speaking
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Billings, not one chance in ten of such an
outcome," exclaimed Fulgencio Higuera.  "Geographically
we belong to the United States.  In politics we are one
with you.  Give us time to think and all of us will say
aye to this."
</p>

<p>
Diego Valencia and others seconded him.
</p>

<p>
"I voted in haste for English rule," said Luis Castro.
"My preference is for your country, Señor Commodore."
</p>

<p>
"And I!  And I!" from a dozen others.
</p>

<p>
Billings shrugged.  "Your California Baja is solid
for England."
</p>

<p>
"I have letters here from Señor Carillo, the Picos,
and others prominent there, stating that these men will
accept what is wisest for the province," replied Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Well said!  Well said!" broke in the heavy voice of
O'Donnell.
</p>

<p>
Billings looked around the room from one face to
another.  Finally, his eyes rested on Mendoza.  "But
there is a possibility if I take your capital that I may
be asked to give it over to the English admiral.  Is that
not true?  Your people, after all, may vote to become
a British dependency," giving the table beside him a
resounding blow with his clenched hand.
</p>

<p>
"A bare possibility&mdash;nothing more," said Mendoza,
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"In which case I should have my trouble for my
pains," asserted the American.
</p>

<p>
"You would, then, have aided a sovereign people to
exercise their right of franchise.  Surely, your government
would uphold you in that.  Besides, the chance is
ten to one&mdash;yes, a hundred to one&mdash;that your flag will
continue flying over the province," argued the
Administrator.
</p>

<p>
Billings's heavy mustachios raised along his face in a
peculiar smile.  His bushy eyebrows were elevated.  In
a moment his features fell into their usual mold.
</p>

<p>
"If I do not take Monterey, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Then comes England," replied Mendoza, his voice
low and even, "and at the present&mdash;the present, mind
you, I say&mdash;an apparent majority of our people would
welcome her coming.  If she comes, she will stay."  He
looked steadily at the other.  "Señor the
Commodore, it may be now or never for the Americans."
</p>

<p>
There was a rush of feet in the corridor, a clatter of
excited native voices, angry expostulations, and then
there burst into the room a figure which startled the
grave assemblage nearly out of its senses.  A man naked
to the waist, his feet cut and bleeding, his face streaked
with dust and perspiration.  He was scarcely able to
stand.
</p>

<p>
"Dios!" exclaimed Mendoza.  "It's Señor Zelaya.
What has happened?"
</p>

<p>
The perspiring, fainting man partially steadied
himself.  "The English fleet sailed&mdash;this morning&mdash;at
daybreak&mdash;toward the south&mdash;decks cleared for
action&mdash;&mdash;"  He collapsed and would have fallen had
not Mendoza caught him.
</p>

<p>
Zelaya soon recovered.  Quickly he told his story.
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!  The English fleet stripped for battle!
Hurrying to Monterey!  I'll shoot their infernal
rudders off!" cried the Commodore.
</p>

<p>
Hamilton, unsheathing his sword, bounded to the side
of his superior.
</p>

<p>
Billings's blade gave answering flash.
</p>

<p>
Excited voices hushed under the swish of steel.
</p>

<p>
The officers and Mendoza strode from the room.
</p>

<p>
O'Donnell was already at his horse's side.
</p>

<p>
"On, for Half Moon Bay!  You, O'Donnell, lead the
way!" shouted Billings.
</p>

<p>
"Faith!  Commodore, I'm in for the race, and it's
bad luck catch the hindmost!" as O'Donnell swung to
the saddle.
</p>

<p>
Tomaso and his peons, signaled by Mendoza, came
hurrying with horses.
</p>

<p>
"I too will ride with the Commodore Americano,"
called Zelaya, forgetful of his fatigue.
</p>

<p>
"Not so, Pedro," from Mendoza.  "A bed and a
surgeon for thee."
</p>

<p>
The Administrator mounted his prized racer, Mercurio.
He waved his hand.  Instantly, Tomaso and his
fighting peons reined their horses behind him in double
file.  Captain Hamilton stood with toe in stirrup,
looking ruefully enough at the prospect of a jolting ride
back to Half Moon Bay.
</p>

<p>
"Fall in, Captain!" called Billings.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the Captain was racing along the road,
not second to many in the run.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br />
THE NEXT DAY
</h3>

<p>
"It's ingratitude, I say, ingratitude worthy of
a&mdash;Catalonian," puffed Colonel Barcelo, striding up
and down the veranda on the second story of his house.
</p>

<p>
"But, dear husband, Captain Morando is not a Catalonian.
He is Castilian, native of Madrid, just the same
as we are."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel paused in his walk and glared at his wife.
"All the worse for him!  All the worse for him!" he
roared.  "He has birth and training of a lion and the
instincts of a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"  Breath failed him.
</p>

<p>
"O, dear husband!" in expostulation.
</p>

<p>
"Dear husband!  Dear husband!" mockingly.  "This
is no time&mdash;&mdash;"  Sufficient breath had not returned to
him to complete his thought.
</p>

<p>
"O, Crisostimo!  Crisostimo!"
</p>

<p>
"Crisostimo!  Crisostimo!" again mocking her.  "I've
always said, Señora Barcelo, that you have no pride,
and that you talk too much."
</p>

<p>
"O, my husband, you don't love me any more.  How
I wish I had never come to California!"
</p>

<p>
"So do I," growled the husband.
</p>

<p>
"How dare you!  How dare you!" bridled the little
woman.  "I believe, now, those stories about your
drinking absinthe and gambling in Paris."
</p>

<p>
"Clarinda, love, I mean I wish <i>we</i> had never come to
California, but that <i>we</i> had remained in Europe."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that sounds different."
</p>

<p>
"As for this Morando, why, confound those
Catalonian instincts in him!"
</p>

<p>
"But he isn't a Catalonian."
</p>

<p>
"I nearly shot a villainous Catalan major once for
less than what Morando has done," he blustered,
ignoring his wife's remark.
</p>

<p>
"What has Captain Morando done?  I'm sure he
is a very good man, and everyone thinks him
handsome."
</p>

<p>
"Handsome!" straightening his shoulders and looking
down at his ample proportions.  "Handsome!  Why,
once at a court ball where I was present half a dozen
princesses&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Were present also, I presume," snappingly
interrupted his wife.  "Well, tell me about Morando."
</p>

<p>
"Clarinda, my dear," sententiously, "I've labored for
position and power, not for my own sake, but that you
should receive what is worthy of you.  That has been
my great ambition," pompously.
</p>

<p>
"How exceedingly nice of you!" half sarcastically
from the señora, not yet quite mollified after her
husband's reference to the princesses.
</p>

<p>
"I had climbed to a place where high honor was
almost mine.  Mexico goes out of California and
England comes in.  I had aimed to gain for myself governorship
of the province, as well as the commandership-in-chief
of all the land forces.  Under England such a
position should satisfy anyone.  It would have satisfied
me&mdash;at least, for the present; that is, my love, when
you would be at my side sharing the honors."
</p>

<p>
"Where else would I be?" her wide-open eyes darkening
a little.
</p>

<p>
"Nowhere else; nowhere else, my love&mdash;not with my
consent."
</p>

<p>
"Nor mine either," firmly.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel floundered a moment.  "Where was I
when interrupted?  O yes.  At last I had attained a
place proper and fitting for me&mdash;and for you, too,
Clarinda.  When I say 'I' I mean you also."
</p>

<p>
"Crisostimo, why didn't you say that at first?"
</p>

<p>
"First!  Say it first!  Well, I meant it first.  Now,
comes this Morando, this villainous Morando&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Crisostimo, he is no such thing," defended the
señora with indignation.
</p>

<p>
"A man whom I have often fed at my own table&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You never did but once," again interrupting.
"Other than that he has never eaten a bite in this house,
except the coffee and cake sister Silvia gave him early
one morning when he happened to be here."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he didn't deserve even that."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino came on the veranda.  "Why, my
dear brother, what has happened?  Your face is red
and perspiring, and you seem excited."
</p>

<p>
"O, Silvia, sweetheart.  Crisostimo has been saying
mean things about your friend Captain Morando."
</p>

<p>
"And with reason," interjected Barcelo, gruffly.
</p>

<p>
"How so?" queried the sister.
</p>

<p>
"My confidence in this Morando has been shattered
to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"And how?"
</p>

<p>
"Just what I've asked him," from the Colonel's wife.
</p>

<p>
"I've just come from an interview with the English
consul here.  Found him closeted with that Farquharson.
Well, they told me the English admiral is to take
possession of Monterey to-morrow," from Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
"Why should that make you say mean things about
the Captain?" asked his wife.
</p>

<p>
He puffed his cheeks and rested his palms upon his
hips, in characteristic pose.  "This Morando has been
laying plans to capture for himself the combined office
of governor and commander-in-chief of this province."
</p>

<p>
"O, Crisostimo," faintly from Señora Barcelo, "this
cannot be true.  You must be mistaken."
</p>

<p>
"Mistaken, wife!  Mistaken!  Why, that Farquharson
told me himself, in cold blood, that Morando is to
be given the office, and the English consul seconded the
fellow."
</p>

<p>
"We all thought so much of the Captain," from his
wife, nearly overcome.
</p>

<p>
"You'll see I'm right about the man," a triumphant
note in the Colonel's voice.
</p>

<p>
"I know you are always right, Crisostimo, love."
</p>

<p>
"Well, poor little Clarinda, you are not to be governor's
wife, nor yet wife of the commander-in-chief," he
commiserated.
</p>

<p>
"We've always made the Captain so welcome when he
came here, and he was such an intimate friend of you,
Silvia.  How could he have meditated such treason
against us all?"
</p>

<p>
"Treason is just the name for it.  But&mdash;England
isn't here yet, and I've got something to say about her
coming.  I am comandante of this presidio."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course!" his wife cheering up.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course!  Of course," exulted the Colonel.
</p>

<p>
"Silvia," asked her sister, "haven't you something
to suggest?  People say you are so bright."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino turned away to hide her smile.
"The English consul and Señor Farquharson told you
that Captain Morando is to receive the honor of which
you speak?" addressing Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it was this way.  You see, I forced their hand.
Just pinned them down; so, yes, or no, was all they
could say," with a knowing nod.
</p>

<p>
A servant entered.  "A message from the porter," she
announced.
</p>

<p>
"Speak!" commanded her master.
</p>

<p>
"An orderly is at the door and requests to see Colonel
Barcelo."
</p>

<p>
"Show him up here."
</p>

<p>
The soldier entered, saluted his commander and
bowed to the women.  "I have the honor to say the
lookout at the castle reports ships entering the outer
harbor."
</p>

<p>
"Coming, are they?  Well, I shall let them see I
am a soldier and a caballero; and, perhaps," moving
his head from side to side, "that I am in command of
the castle here.  Clarinda, where is my new uniform?
I shall appear in that, as befits the occasion."
</p>

<p>
The Colonel's wife, all a-flutter, took his arm and
walked with him down the veranda stairs, Señora
Valentino following.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere of Monterey was tense with feeling
that morning.  By some telepathy news of the expected
event had spread out from the capital.  Hamlet,
hacienda, and Indian rancheria were alike agog.
</p>

<p>
"Benito, the horses," called Barcelo, coming to the
porte-cochere.
</p>

<p>
The acting governor made an imposing figure in his
full colonel's regimentals.  He mounted his horse with
heavy dignity.  "Wife, and sister Silvia, you ride with me."
</p>

<p>
They rode along the street to the public square.
Already it bore resemblance to a fiesta day.  Sidewalks
were lined with men talking with lightninglike rapidity
between puffs of their cigaritos.  Peon and ranchero
joined in the talk.  Windows, verandas, roofs, even,
were splendid in the vari-colored dress and headgear
of the señora, señorita and peona.  The whole world
of Monterey became akin under stress of the greatest
day it had ever known.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel endeavored to push rapidly through the
square on his way to the castle.  He was one of very
many bent on the same errand.  Carretas strained and
squeaked in the press; horses snorted, reared, plunged;
pedestrians risked life and limb by darting hither and
thither, as opening presented.
</p>

<p>
"Out of the way!  Out of the way!" Barcelo shouted
after a little.  "Here I am, only half way to the castle.
Out of the way, I say!  The Governor and his party are
coming."
</p>

<p>
Two carretas going in opposite directions had locked
wheels.  The postilions were hurling curses and threats
at each other; the occupants of the vehicles were
screaming, while numerous fellow travelers were lavishly
advising the best manner of breaking up the obstruction.
</p>

<p>
"Peste!" again from the Colonel.  "Give way!  Give
way!  Such drivers should be knocked senseless!"
</p>

<p>
Peons now seized the teams by the bridles; others
pulled and tugged at the carretas until each was backed
into freedom.
</p>

<p>
The stream of life once more toiled onward toward
the castle.  The Barcelos were carried on its bosom.
</p>

<p>
The old castle was built on a bluff overlooking
Monterey harbor.  Its black-mouthed guns had long gaped
over the quiet of the land-locked waters, and its
buttressed walls meant safety to padre, Indian neophyte,
and Spanish hacendado.
</p>

<p>
The fort had been called "castle" by its builders when
the flag of Spain waved over the Californias.  Its
appointments were mediæval.  The moss-grown walls
betokened decay; while the crumbling cement in the
rock-ribbed abutments told the same story.  Its ordnance
was ranged to protect harbor and approaches.  Moreover,
it had protected them.  Within the memory of the
present generation two robber vessels had attempted
to force entrance.  The cannon thundered and one
buccaneer boat laid her bones at the bottom of the
bay; while the other, white flag at masthead, sued for
mercy.
</p>

<p>
A long line of soldiers held the crowd at proper
distance from the castle.  The Colonel, with his wife and
sister-in-law, made his way to the entrance, then along
wide corridor and winding stair to the upper battlement.
</p>

<p>
Silently they looked out over the unheeding water.
The surf murmured beneath them.  The ocean nestled
lazily against the horizon.  Seabirds floated aimlessly in
the air; or, with piercing cry, hurtled downward for the
finny creatures below the surface of the swell.
</p>

<p>
Fishing smacks, ever ready to dare the roughest
weather on prospect of full nets and ready market, now,
careless of both, had found sheltered nooks whence to
await the great happening.  Other boats swayed at
anchor near the beach.
</p>

<p>
"Major Silva," asked Barcelo of his second in
command, "is our lookout sure he saw the fleet?  I see
nothing here."
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely certain, Colonel.  His glass showed them
plainly from the tower nearly an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  See that mob out there doesn't push in
any nearer."
</p>

<p>
The Major saluted and departed.
</p>

<p>
"The whole countryside seems to have pulled itself
up by its boots and jumped into town; but as for that
much-bragged of English fleet, there is not a sign.  I,
for one, don't believe it's coming.  Bah!" blustered
Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
"Comandante, the foreign consuls are at the gate,"
announced an orderly.
</p>

<p>
"Show them here."
</p>

<p>
The Comandante received them all with words and
manner ceremoniously polite.
</p>

<p>
Glasses searched sky and water line, but in vain.
Colonel Barcelo went from bastion to bastion calling to
his side the gunners of each piece of artillery.
</p>

<p>
Chance sentences which had fallen here and there
now thickened into connected conversation, as little
groups were formed.
</p>

<p>
"Your words stirred up my brother-in-law this morning,"
Señora Valentino said in quick aside to Captain
Farquharson, who had accompanied the consuls to the
castle.
</p>

<p>
"It was the eleventh hour.  He asked me a blunt question
and I could do nothing but give him a plain answer.
He cannot harm us."
</p>

<p>
"Fairbanks is not keen on this prize, Captain,"
moving her head thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
Señora Barcelo came to her sister's side.  "Silvia,
look through this spyglass&mdash;over that ledge, then to
where that thin scroll of fog dips down to the water."
</p>

<p>
Conversation ceased, and a dozen glasses scanned the
spot.
</p>

<p>
A strip of white rose into sight, glanced in the sun,
darkened, then gleamed like a sunflash on ice.  To the
left was another, then another.  Suddenly, four more
projected into plain view on the right.
</p>

<p>
"The fleet!  The fleet!" chorused every side.
</p>

<p>
Breezes of late forenoon freshened over the harbor.
Headland and sky line cleared of feathery mist.
</p>

<p>
The seven ships, every sail set, hove into full sight.
</p>

<p>
Captain Farquharson, resting his hands on a parapet,
scrutinized eagerly the nearing men-of-war.  His
wish framed a thought which he believed Fairbanks's
coming vitalized.
</p>

<p>
Thirty years ago Spain's nerveless hand fell from
the Californias, leaving them to Mexico.  Mexico's
hold, feeble always, year by year had loosened.  To-day
would see the end.
</p>

<p>
His daydream grew.
</p>

<p>
The pushing, restless Saxon of Atlantic America,
after overflowing the valley of the Mississippi, would
not bring his civilization to the farthest West.  Ford
rivers, traverse deserts, fell forests as he might, at last
he would meet a difficulty he could not surmount, the
backfiring line of a civilization, virile as his own,
wrought by the hand of his English cousin, and this day
begun in the capital, Monterey.  Another empire was
about to come under Great Britain's sway.
</p>

<p>
"Señors!" Comandante Barcelo's voice, low and
tense, broke the stillness.
</p>

<p>
Farquharson started from his reverie.
</p>

<p>
With bellying sails the fleet came scudding on, the
dark hulls scarcely touching the water.  Fairbanks's
flagship was in the lead, her commander's pennant
flinging from the foremast, the union jack streaming
above.  Back from the leader, in triangular spread, as
wild fowl move, followed the others, three on a side.
</p>

<p>
"Señors, attention!" again from Barcelo.  "Let us
have understanding right here and now.  You people
have come here to-day to see a province pass from hand
to hand, but," pointing to the cannon, "straight words
from the throats of these jolly boys here shall speak
a salute the aspiring English little expect.  You, men
of the consulate, go, tell your nations, California scorns
any yoke."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" cried Farquharson.  "Our ships will
batter this ramshackle to pieces in ten minutes."
</p>

<p>
Barcelo exploded a tremendous, "Huh!" then added,
"No need keeps you here.  The casemates are at your
disposal."
</p>

<p>
"Perdition on your folly!" from the angry Englishman.
"Why, man, I've faced death a score more times
than you have fingers and toes, you insufferable ass!"
</p>

<p>
"Another word, and I'll clap you in irons!" was
Barcelo's threat.  Turning to the women he said, "It is
time for the señoras to seek safety below."
</p>

<p>
"I shall remain here," from Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"I shall stay, also," announced the Colonel's wife.
</p>

<p>
"Señoras, I insist that you go below&mdash;and at once!
Orderly, take these ladies down immediately.  As for
you," turning to the men, "you can suit yourselves.
Stay, if you will&mdash;if your noses itch for powder
smoke."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson glowered at the Colonel, but did not
speak.  The surprised civilians hurriedly grouped
themselves against a parapet.
</p>

<p>
The flagship stood in to the sheltered lea of the
harbor.  As a thing alive she ran.  At each onward bound
she raised her forefoot clear, then plunged nose-deep
into the churning spray.  Her bulging canvas gleamed
against the distant background.
</p>

<p>
The Admiral and his officers were on the quarterdeck.
Marines and man-o'-war's men swarmed aft.
</p>

<p>
"Make ready!" called Barcelo.
</p>

<p>
Each cannoneer stood by the priming of his piece,
a lighted fuse spluttering in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Fire!" shouted the Colonel, in voice so carrying that
it reached the city square.
</p>

<p>
The old cannon mouths belched response.
</p>

<p>
Sheets of flame and smoke darted into the empty
air.  Over town and rolling land awoke a thousand
echoes.
</p>

<p>
The fort shivered to its venerable foundation.
</p>

<p>
Across the harbor ricocheted the heavy shots, dotting
a path straight to Fairbanks's ship.  A school of flying
fish these shots might have been, moistening their fins
now and then, to show that water was their element.
They dropped below the surface, as seeking rest, short
of their destination a hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
"Elevate the muzzles of the guns!" yelled Barcelo.
"Quick!  the levers.  Swing them in place!  Bear down!
Bear down, I tell you!  Bring props.  Now, get to
work!  Load again!"
</p>

<p>
Swabbers labored with might and main.  Powder
carriers came stumbling through the clinging smoke.
Sinewy arms strained under the iron shot.
</p>

<p>
Seizing a ramrod, with his own hands the sooty and
perspiring Colonel worked shoulder to shoulder with
his men.
</p>

<p>
Signal flags arose, fluttered, fell, on the Admiral's
vessel.  Sailors swarmed through the rigging, like flies.
Sails shortened, as by magic.  Under lessened speed
she swung until her length paralleled the water-front.
</p>

<p>
"Up with the white flag, Colonel Barcelo!  Hurry!
Hurry!  Hurry!  For God's sake, give the order!"
cried Farquharson.  "She's ready for a broadside."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he ran to the flagstaff.  The consuls,
storming and demanding, followed him, and made as if
to lower the colors.
</p>

<p>
Barcelo halted them with drawn pistol.  "Stand
away! you squealing rats.  I'll shoot the man who
touches a halyard."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman stepped back; likewise, the others.
</p>

<p>
"O, our wives and children!" some one hoarsely
cried.
</p>

<p>
"Comandante, for the love of God, bethink yourself!"
remonstrated Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"Sight those guns!" persisted Barcelo in a voice of
thunder.  "Now's your time!  The ship's showing bottom
like a dying fish.  Hit the line, men, between air and
water!  Fire!"
</p>

<p>
Hill and valley again boomed in angry refrain.  Over
the bay skimmed the shot, true poised for distance, but
scattering a course a quarter mile from the flagship's
side.
</p>

<p>
Deck and port-hole of the great vessel frowned on
the upstart who dared dispute the coming of the giant.
</p>

<p>
Away from the castle grounds in confusion tumbled
the crowds that had so gayly come to enjoy a holiday.
</p>

<p>
Panic-stricken, Monterey held its breath, each instant
seeing the next instant terrible in red destruction, to
satisfy the Briton's vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Still the flagship swung, the circle widening, her
cannon sullenly silent.
</p>

<p>
Helm hard down, she put about till Monterey lay
astern.  Her sails unfurled.  Proud in the knowledge
of her unused strength she spurned castle and capital
and made majestically for the open sea.
</p>

<p>
One by one the warships wheeled and followed the
leader, in triangular lines, as before.
</p>

<p>
The sea-breeze lifted from the castle the thick, black
smoke-cloud.  The gunners, begrimed and eager, held
by their pieces.
</p>

<p>
Farquharson, white with suppressed rage, paced the
battlement.
</p>

<p>
The consuls were gathered in knots of twos and
threes.
</p>

<p>
Barcelo, grim and aloof, stood with folded arms and
watched the departing fleet until the last speck dropped
from sight.
</p>

<p>
On the way home, an hour later, Señora Valentino
volunteered to the Colonel: "Well, the British ships
have come&mdash;and gone."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;and I am still comandante," bluster reasserting
itself.  Then, to his wife: "That peon valet laid
out my new uniform all right, but he gave me my old
sword belt.  There's simply no depending on the fellow."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br />
BROWN TAKES A HAND AT DIPLOMACY
</h3>

<p>
"The consummate sentimental bookworm!  He
hasn't gumption enough to manage a hedge
school."  Farquharson threw himself into a chair and
crossed his legs, knocking over another chair in the
process.  It was in the house of the English consul.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't caught breath after the pandemonium this
morning," returned the consul.  "I'm glad to be back
here alive."
</p>

<p>
"See here, Twickenham, you're a civilian, and have
no stomach for fighting, and not to blame either; but
Fairbanks is a fighting machine.  It's his business to
shoot and be shot at.  Sentiment is out of place in a
commander of a fleet.  A plague on him!  Barcelo flips
a few birdshot out of a brace or two of pill boxes.  The
British nation bows.  Well, you saw the farce this
morning.  By Jove!  I'll have Fairbanks before the
high court, to answer for his work&mdash;or lack of
it."  Farquharson was now nervously stepping up and down
the room.
</p>

<p>
"I've had my signal-fires on the hills since noon,
asking the Admiral to meet me.  I want it to be on land, or
anywhere off his ships.  On neutral ground I'm free
to call his conduct by the name it deserves.  England
has suffered humiliation to-day, and all because of him!
The dolt!"
</p>

<p>
"I thought the ship would begin bombardment at
once.  I don't mind confessing that 'twas a dread time
as far as I was concerned."
</p>

<p>
"Begin bombardment!" Farquharson paused in his
walk.  "Why didn't he blast the old fort into nothingness,
and California would be ours.  I'll wake him when
I meet him."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, Captain!  If that blasting process of
yours had gone on, we, personally, wouldn't possess
California, or anything else, now."
</p>

<p>
"O, Twickenham!  Well, you're not a fighting man.
Besides, Admiral Fairbanks didn't know we were in
the castle.  Furthermore, there was safety enough in
the subways, if we had minded to go there."
</p>

<p>
Again he threw himself into a chair, and began
fuming anew.  "Now, there's Señora Valentino!  She
left Europe, and all that this meant to the woman she
is.  She has come to this out-of-the-way place&mdash;worked
hard! and conscientiously!  And for what?  By the
way, the señora should be here.  She sent word she's
heard something important.  She's five minutes overdue
as it is."
</p>

<p>
"That clock is fast, Captain."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson looked at his watch.  "Only two minutes
fast."  He was on his feet again.  "What can have
kept her!"
</p>

<p>
"O, sit down, Farquharson.  Let's talk over this
matter."
</p>

<p>
"Talk over the matter!  That's just the trouble.  It's
talk, talk, talk!&mdash;and nothing done!  Just wait till I
meet Fairbanks!  I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now, see here, Captain Farquharson.  I'm only a
business man, and I don't know anything about fighting,
as you intimate.  But, can't you and the señora
bring Barcelo to some reasonable attitude in this affair?
Have him and Admiral Fairbanks arrange an entente
cordiale, so that Monterey will pass into our hands
without a repetition of this morning's fusillade."
</p>

<p>
The consul's wife ushered in Señora Valentino.
</p>

<p>
"Friends, I have received news from Half Moon Bay,"
the señora announced, coming to the point at once, and
waiving all greetings.
</p>

<p>
"Of Billings's fleet?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The sloop-of-war, the Cyane, went aground
some time yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"How did the news come?  Is it authentic?"
</p>

<p>
"It is, Captain.  Alberto, the peon, brought me word.
By day and night he hurried."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid, señora!"
</p>

<p>
"Commodore Billings has only one other vessel, and
that is his flagship, the United States," added the
señora.
</p>

<p>
"Billings isn't likely to try to force the harbor with
a single boat.  The Yankee's mishap is our opportunity."
</p>

<p>
"But the Cyane may float at highest tide which comes
in a few days now."
</p>

<p>
The señora then added significantly: "The United
States can care little for this territory, judging from
the weakness of their Pacific fleet.  We must press this
on our reluctant Admiral."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we'll have to coax him back into Monterey, as a
mother leads a bashful child into company.  But&mdash;that
bumptious Barcelo!  What has he to say of his
conduct?  California voted to come under our protection,
he with the others.  What, under heaven's name,
prompted him?"
</p>

<p>
"The real man was to the fore this morning, Captain.
His blustering second self was submerged."
</p>

<p>
"Second self submerged?  Well!  And did the
cannonading in that rickety fort settle the dregs?  My
word!  But what does he say of it all?"
</p>

<p>
"That his honor demanded the resistance."
</p>

<p>
"Then, why in the world didn't he think of that when
he voted at the baile?  Not bid us to gather our basket
of eggs, only to throw a bowlder into the midst."
</p>

<p>
"The Colonel's mind was on cribbage that night
rather than on the province."
</p>

<p>
"And the coming of the ships took his mind from
cards to fighting," elevating his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Disappointed ambition did that."
</p>

<p>
"Disappointed ambition?  Señora, we gave him no
assurance of office under our regime."
</p>

<p>
"No, but he cherished the desire, and importuned you
this morning to confirm it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he received his answer."  The Captain's back
stiffened.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Captain Farquharson, and he gave us his.  The
soldier of other days awoke."
</p>

<p>
"I should say he did!  I wish his popguns had shaken
into Fairbanks some of that same spirit."
</p>

<p>
The señora rose to go.  "A message will bring me,
Captain, when you get in touch with the Admiral."
</p>

<p>
"I am expecting each moment to hear from him.  At
least he can use his guns to fire signals."
</p>

<p>
Both Farquharson and Twickenham attended the
lady to the street.
</p>

<p>
The holiday appearance was gone from the capital.
Many of the residents had taken themselves and their
families out of the possible-danger zone.  The others
remained well within the shadow of their own rooftrees.
</p>

<p>
Farquharson's horse took him to the high ground
back of the city.  Reaching perpendicularly from a
half dozen hills were thin pillars of signal smoke.
Touching the upper air drafts they bent horizonward,
and drifted slowly into nothingness.
</p>

<p>
"My smoke does its work all right, but Fairbanks's
guns appear to be dumb.  Drat the fellow!"
</p>

<p>
His glasses pointed out to sea.  For a moment, by
chance, it rested on the town below.
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyway Monterey will learn that every day
isn't a fiesta day."  He half chuckled.
</p>

<p>
Again he directed his attention to the smoke now
ascending in fresh volume as peons replenished the fires.
Again he swept the ocean with his spyglass.
</p>

<p>
A small boat was landing on the beach below the
castle.  The crew, waist-deep in water, was sliding it in,
on the crest of a breaker.  One man separated from the
others and walked toward the town.  The spyglass
covered him, though Farquharson's thoughts were elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
"Why!  Why!" in a moment, "it's old Brown.  What's
he been doing on a native fishing-boat?"
</p>

<p>
He shut his glass together; looked once more at the
smoke columns, then cantered down the hill.  He came
on his former employee near the plaza.
</p>

<p>
"How do, Brown?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine, Cap'.  How are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Glad to see you, Brown."
</p>

<p>
"Same here, Cap'.  I'm powerful glad."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson and the Missourian gripped in cordial
handshake.
</p>

<p>
"Brown, I just saw you leave that sailboat.  Are you
engaged in catching fish?"
</p>

<p>
Brown leaned against the Captain's horse, tangled
his hand in its mane, crossed one foot over the other,
and said: "Nary fishin', Cap'."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's a deep-sea fishing-boat."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon.  But I didn't fish none in that craft."
</p>

<p>
"Out for pleasure, then.  Well, what have you been
doing with yourself since I saw you last?"
</p>

<p>
Brown wagged his head.
</p>

<p>
"Cap', I signed up with you in Santa Fé on prospect
of big game huntin' and adventure.  Well, there's been
no big game, but I'm meetin' adventure, at last."
</p>

<p>
"I'm much interested.  I presume you were in this
boat when the bombardment was going on this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Nope.  Only met her a while back.  Cap', you
couldn't guess where I was this mornin'."
</p>

<p>
"Well," laughing, "as you would say, I reckon not."
</p>

<p>
Brown wagged his head once more, placed his back
squarely against the horse, and announced impressively:
"Cap'n Farquharson, this mornin' I was on
the flagship of Ad<i>my</i>ral Fairbanks."
</p>

<p>
The Captain dropped the bridle-rein in his
astonishment.  The horse sidled away suddenly, and Brown
nearly lost his equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
"Admiral Fairbanks's flagship!" incredulously.
"Why, I thought you had taken service with Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
Brown recovered balance.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Mendoza has hired me to work for him
at Mission San José, and I was on Ad<i>my</i>ral Fairbanks's
ship this mornin'."
</p>

<p>
"How in the name of common sense, man, can you
reconcile the two things?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Cap', let me say, there's some things I won't
speak of, seein' they're political and we're on different
sides."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Brown; tell me how you came to be
with Fairbanks to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Cap', yesterday mornin' a bunch of Injuns
were rowin' me out to one of our warships, for what
purpose I'll not say."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Brown.  It was doubtless at Half Moon
Bay.  But never mind, go on."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Cap', whether it was or not, we got lost in
the fog.  Never saw so thick a fog.  Couldn't see a rowlock."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, my Injuns rowed and rowed, and palavered,
and what not.  Then, they began cryin' and prayin'-like,
and I understood we was lost.  Hours went by.
Waves began splashin' into the boat later, and I knew
we had got out to sea.  Innards felt awkward.  Small
boat's a mean place for seasickness."
</p>

<p>
"Brown, I mean no offense, but will you not tell me,
in a few words, how you happened into Fairbanks's
flagship?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  Fine ship she is.  You ever been on board, Cap'?"
</p>

<p>
Farquharson laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You are the same old Brown, I see.  Now, forge
ahead."
</p>

<p>
"Sure pop, Cap'.  Injuns finally gave up, dropped
oars and lay down in the bottom of the boat.  I didn't
blame 'em; fact there was as much sense in that as
doin' anything else, under the circumstances."
</p>

<p>
The Englishman leaned on the pommel and waited
resignedly.
</p>

<p>
"All suddenly the wind began to blow harder.  Whew! but
she came a-kitin'.  Seen the same thing many a time
on the Mississippi River.  Boat pitched like a log
fallin' down hill.  Boss Injun grabbed the tiller, and
howled jabber-talk at the others like all-possessed.
Oarsmen got their paddles goin' in no time.  Didn't
think such quick work was in the critters."
</p>

<p>
"Brown&mdash;I'm&mdash;listening."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Cap'.  I'll go on talkin'.  Well, fog
began clearin'.  The Injuns took heart; put the boat
about and started off for somewhere.  First thing I
knew, we were in trouble again.  The ocean pitched
wors'n before, though the wind had eased up.  Soon,
sir, our boat lifted clear of the water and dived down
like a duck.  Yes, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me I went along on down for ten fathoms
anyway.  Awfullest commotion under there you ever
heard of.  All the time I was thinkin', yes, sir, thinking
that as much as I wanted adventure I wasn't lookin'
for it on the bottom of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
"Then, I began whirlin', till I didn't know anything.
First I remember I was top of the waves once more,
sort o' dazed like, and whippin' away from us, like a
hurricane, was an all-fired big ship.  She was just
a-clippin' it, knots and knots per hour.  You see,
we'd been caught in her wash, and just naturally capsized."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes.  It was the flagship, was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Certain, Cap', and neat work she did pickin' us
up.  I was floatin' on my back, tryin' to think, when
a rowboat came along.  A couple of sailors caught
me by my midships and shirt collar.  In no time I was
across a thwart, head hangin' down, and the sea-water
just boilin' out o' my mouth.  Sooner than I could tell
it every one of the Injuns was aboard and likewise
bein' deprived of the water they'd swallowed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the big boat slowed up and waited.  Our
rowboat was soon alongside, and we were hauled up."
</p>

<p>
"So, Fairbanks brought you to Monterey and
dropped you on that fishing smack.  Brown, I'm glad
you've met with an adventure at last.  The fleet was
off the harbor when you left, was it not?  The entire
seven ships, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Cap', the seven ships were out there all right.  But
I don't consider that capsizin' my real adventure.  No,
sir!"
</p>

<p>
"You met another mishap?" turning his bridle-rein,
and looking at the signal smoke.  "I hope it terminated
as well for you as the first.  What was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nary mishap.  Last night I had an interview with
the Ad<i>my</i>ral."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson's attention quickly turned back to
Brown.  "An interview with Fairbanks?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And I had another this afternoon, a bunch
of officers bein' present.  I consider these interviews
worthy of the name of adventure."
</p>

<p>
"Man, man, what are you talking about?"
</p>

<p>
"About interviews and adventures, Cap'.  You were
askin' about 'em.  Do you mind my telling you, friend
Cap', that you seem sort o' forgetful and
absent-mindedlike?  Guess I'll be goin'."  The American made
a move to depart and held out his hand to Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Brown, don't go.  I'll pull my wits together.
I'm more than interested.  Your interviews appeared
so big to me that I couldn't just catch it at first.  Now,
please tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Cap'.  Since you're so interested I'll
begin at the beginnin'.  First, I and the Injuns were
taken to a real nice place.  Beds were there, and everything
looked fine.  A feller in uniform came 'round, the
ship's doctor, and ordered me to 'get out o' those
clothes.'  My clothes were wet and uncomfortable,
anyway, so I didn't mind 'em off, and off they came.  He
poked and pulled me most unmerciful.  'You're not
hurt,' said he, when I'd got so mad I wouldn't have stood
another poke.  'I'd have told you that in the beginnin','
I informed him.  Then to another uniformed feller he
called.  'Brandy for him, a full gill, and get him some
dry clothes.'  Well, the Injuns&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Brown, let's come to that interview as soon as we
can.  Of course I would like to hear every particular,
but time is rather short just now, and I do want to hear
all about your talk with the Admiral."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson's horse caught his master's impatience
and pranced around the American.  Brown pivoted,
keeping his face turned to the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Now, see here, Cap', if I tell you it all, it's likely
to rile you up.  But it's no secret.  I'd be willin' to tell
it to anybody; and, between man and man, I'd rather
you'd hear it from me than from somebody else.  On
the whole, I'm glad I've a chance to tell you, myself,
bein' that we've been such good friends.  'Course, Cap',
I'd be sorry to lose your friendship, but politics is
politics, and I talked to the Ad<i>my</i>ral to boost my own side,
which same side is the United States."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Brown.  I hope you will tell it all.  I know
very well which side you're on, and, as you say, 'Politics
is politics!'"
</p>

<p>
"All right, just as you say, Cap'.  A uniformed man
brought me some clothes.  He was chaplain.  Nice,
clever young feller he was.  I soon got into them clothes.
I engaged him in conversation, as to his place of
residence, and so forth.  Then he engaged me."  Brown's
language assumed company dress for the moment.  He
straightened up, took off his hat, and continued:
</p>

<p>
"The chaplain said to me, 'You're familiar with
Monterey, are you?'  'Yes,' I said.  'I was 'round there
considerable when I worked for Cap'n Farquharson.'
Cap', he knew you like a book.  Said I, 'The Cap'n
is smart on politics, but his politics don't go in
California.'  'Why not?' he asked me.  'We won't have it,'
I said.  'Who?' he asked again.  'The American nation,'
I said, 'represented by the American fleet, "Seenyore"
Mendoza, and no end of Spanish big fellers.  They're
clear agen it, and so am I.'
</p>

<p>
"The chaplain perked up a good deal at this.  I went
on.  '"Seenyore" Mendoza, my present employer,
fought old Napoleon,' said I.  'The "Seenyore" came
here, I reckon, to get rid of tyrants.  He'll fight to
the last ditch before he'll let any of 'em get in here,
and I'm with him.'
</p>

<p>
"The young preacher looked some serious now.  He
went away after a while."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Brown, please."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Cap'.  The name of the Ad<i>my</i>ral's boat
is the Vanguard, I forgot to say.  Well, after supper
the preacher came 'round again.  'The Ad<i>my</i>ral wants
to see you,' he said."
</p>

<p>
"You went, of course; and what happened there?"
</p>

<p>
"I could see from the start the preacher was strong
with the Ad<i>my</i>ral.  'Mr. Blair tells me you are familiar
with Monterey,' the Ad<i>my</i>ral said.  'I'm pretty familiar,'
I told him.  The Ad<i>my</i>ral's room's fixed up fine,
almost like Mr. Mendoza's parlor, only not so big.
'You're the Brown who was in Cap'n Farquharson's
service for a time?' he asked knowin'-like.  'If you mean
his employ, yes,' I said.  'I've heard the Cap'n speak
of you as an honest feller,' he went on pleasant enough,
but watchin' sharp's a cat at a mouse-hole.  I remarked
to him, 'I and all my folks are honest, makin' it a point
to be square in money matters.'
</p>

<p>
"'You've quit Cap'n Farquharson's employ?' he
asked.  'Yes,' I said.  'How was that?' said he.  'O, for
reasons,' said I, and shut up like a clam.  You see, Cap',
he was askin' personal questions, which I don't allow no
man, providin' I don't want to answer.
</p>

<p>
"In a minute he inquired casuallike, 'You're now in
the employ of "Seenyore" Mendoza, is that it?'  I replied
very shortlike, 'I am,' and started to shut up like
another clam, then I thought better of it and blurted
out, 'The "Seenyore" is determined no king sets up in
business 'round this part o' the world.'
</p>

<p>
"'Where does this "Seenyore" live?' asked the Ad<i>my</i>ral.
'At Mission San José,' I told him.  'Mission San
José?  How long?'  'Ever since he quit fightin' old
Napoleon, I reckon,' I said.  I tell you, that Ad<i>my</i>ral's
eyes opened wide.  'Has the "Seenyore" a following in
the province?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I was gettin' pretty mad about then.  I told him
about the riflemen Mr. Mendoza has drillin', and
drillin', Spaniards, Injuns, and all.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the Ad<i>my</i>ral looked away and looked away.
Then suddenly he asked, 'Describe Mendoza's appearance.'  I
pretty soon did.  'Yes, the same man,' he said.
</p>

<p>
"He was awful quiet for a minute, then he spoke out
to himself like.  'Why has no one told me about
Mendoza's activities here?  He's a man to be taken into
consideration.  I knew him years ago.'
</p>

<p>
"Finally the Ad<i>my</i>ral said, 'I'll test it out.  Sail into
Monterey, just as we'd planned.'
</p>

<p>
"I spoke up, 'Monterey don't want you.  If anybody
says they do, it's politics.  Mebbe you can shoot all
these cannon at 'em tell they couldn't fight back any
more, but just the same they don't want you.'
</p>

<p>
"The Ad<i>my</i>ral looked mighty queer.  When I left
he was still thinkin' and thinkin'.
</p>

<p>
"We sailed into Monterey harbor and out again, I
still stayin' on the Ad<i>my</i>ral's boat, bein's I couldn't get
off, the walkin' not bein' exactly what you'd call good.
</p>

<p>
"First thing I knew, I was in the Ad<i>my</i>ral's room a
second time.  A power of officers were there from the
other ships.  'Repeat your statement of last night, if
you will,' he asked of me.  Well, I did.  Then the
Ad<i>my</i>ral spoke up, 'The man's words were verified this
mornin' by the fort firin' on us.'
</p>

<p>
"The officers looked black as thunder.  One big feller
said, 'Reduce their defenses and invest the city at once.'
the Ad<i>my</i>ral replied, 'I've no call to take Monterey, if
she's unwillin', and I'll not do it.'
</p>

<p>
"Another officer spoke up, savage as the dickens.
'The honor of her Majesty's navy is assailed.  Let the
fleet take over the city!'  'Not while I'm commandin'
the fleet,' put in the Ad<i>my</i>ral.
</p>

<p>
"They were talkin' when I left.  Mebbe they're at it
yet.  The fishboat was waitin' for me and the Injuns.
She skimmed through the waves like grease, and here
I be."
</p>

<p>
"Confounded chicken-hearted cad!" the Captain exploded.
</p>

<p>
"How!" from Brown sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I refer to Fairbanks."
</p>

<p>
"Fine old gent.  Even if his politics does differ from
mine I'm not agen him as such."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson stared at the sea.  "Well, your friend
Fairbanks, the Admiral, has done what might be
expected from him."
</p>

<p>
"I reckon you know him better'n I do."
</p>

<p>
"Brown, you have done devilish work."  Farquharson's
face turned on the other.
</p>

<p>
"Cap', if it's harm to you personal, I'm sorry.  If
it's to your side in politics, as I reckon it is, I'm
all-fired glad."
</p>

<p>
The Captain continued looking at Brown for a
minute.  His frown faded.  "You've had your
adventure, old man, and you've hunted big game.  Yes, by
Jove! and bagged it too."  A curious smile crept over
his features.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I haven't got it with me, Cap'."
</p>

<p>
"Say, Brown, when you went out yesterday toward
that warship of yours, did you see that the Cyane&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, you don't, Cap'.  That there's where secrets
come in, secrets from you and your side."
</p>

<p>
"Boom!  Boom!&mdash;Boom!  Boom!  Boom!&mdash;Boom!
Boom!" sounded from the sea.
</p>

<p>
Farquharson listened intently.
</p>

<p>
The signal was repeated.  "Boom!  Boom!&mdash;Boom!
Boom!  Boom!&mdash;Boom!  Boom!"
</p>

<p>
"Yerba&mdash;Buena&mdash;to-morrow," Farquharson muttered,
anger clinching his teeth, as his horse, under a vicious
jab of the spur, dashed forward and into the town,
unceremoniously leaving Brown.
</p>

<p>
"Signaling, hey?  Them cannons were boomers, all
right.  I've been noticing that smoke, back up on the
hills, all the time I was talkin' to the Cap', and I
expected to see or hear somethin' answer back."
</p>

<p>
He walked leisurely through the plaza and reached
the city just in time to see Farquharson and Señora
Valentino ride away in hurried gallop.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, ah!  Simon J. Brown, get to work yourself.
Find a horse and light out for the north."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br />
BRAVING THE STORM
</h3>

<p>
"A hurricane in midsummer in the temperate
zone.  A raging ocean, named Pacific.  A non-combatant
admiral commanding a fighting fleet.  What
a diabolical combination!"
</p>

<p>
"Add, the hurricane is piling water on the swelling
tides at Half Moon Bay.  Soon, the Cyane, willy, nilly,
deserts her sand-banks," was Señora Valentino's doleful
contribution.
</p>

<p>
"And the Yankee commodore flies his flag over
Monterey, appending the province to Yankeedom.  Blast
it all!  I'd give a kingdom&mdash;&mdash;"  He paused.
</p>

<p>
"'For a horse,' does your Shakespeare say?" smiling
a little.  "There is only one thing left.  If the mountain
does not come to Mohammed, then Mohammed must go
to the mountain."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, put out in a small boat to the flagship, you
mean?  It would be futile, and surely end in death.
Now, let us go to the top of the hill."
</p>

<p>
A bluff thickly wooded with scrub oak had sheltered
them.  Their sure-footed horses nimbly climbed a
precipitous path zigzagging to the summit.
</p>

<p>
"See, señora.  Look, if you can."
</p>

<p>
They were on Point Lobos crest, overhanging San
Francisco Bay, with Yerba Buena village straggling
along the harbor line.
</p>

<p>
Grit and sand whistled through the air, biting the
skin, choking the throat and stinging the eyes.  With
arched backs and drooping heads their mounts met the
storm.  A hundred invisible angry hands buffeted the
man and woman thus inquisitively breasting the humor
of the elements.
</p>

<p>
The wind lessened, as wearied by too great exertion.
The spiteful sand-drive ceased.  Dimly at first, then
plainly, yellow dunes hummocked into sight.  Speaking
the fury of a half hemisphere of water rose the
crescendo of the surf.
</p>

<p>
Through the thinning haze they peered toward the
west.  There was the sea.  Miles away, under bare poles,
save here and there a strip of canvas, struggled the
English fleet, each ship face to the gale, the spyglass
showed them, now rising on beam end; now sliding prow
downward; then teetering and dancing.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, Fairbanks dares not enter the harbor.  It
is equally impossible for me to get out to him.  The
storm is rising again.  We must return to the village."
</p>

<p>
Gusts of wind pursued them as they hastened over
yielding sand and wild strawberry-plot, or broke
through scrub-brush and tree-growth.  Pitiless dust-clouds
drove them again from the open to the protection
of a bluff.
</p>

<p>
They started out once more.
</p>

<p>
"Captain," in half-stifled voice, "this is the third day
Fairbanks's vessels have stood there performing antics.
No?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, señora, and the third day we have been in
Yerba Buena waiting for Fairbanks to keep his tryst
with us.  A hundred times we have gone over this.  I
feel greatly to blame that I consented to bring you out
into this simoon again to-day.  What good?"
</p>

<p>
"But, think you, to-morrow is highest tide.  If
Commodore Billings's sloop-of-war floats, no hurricane
keeps him from blockading Monterey.  Yes, and the
guns of Colonel Barcelo could not prevent him from
seizing castle and city."
</p>

<p>
"Fairbanks should be shot!"
</p>

<p>
"Captain, had Barcelo been kept in ignorance as to
the spoils of office his latent patriotism might still be
slumbering; but your English truthfulness was too
much for even a wise diplomat like yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I was a fool! an inexcusable fool!  But who would
have thought the Comandante capable of such vim and
sudden action?  Besides, señora, there was Brown.  He
stirred up quite a kettle of fish in his own way."
</p>

<p>
"True.  But Fairbanks put in, notwithstanding
Brown, and would have occupied the city, had his
reception been more cordial."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Of course both circumstances worked hand in hand.
Doubtless, neither by itself would have deterred
Fairbanks.  In any event, it's no use repining."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind, señora.  Curse it all
anyway!"  After
several moments in which neither spoke,
Farquharson continued: "Well, Brown; good old Brown.
He's a mighty decent fellow, true to his colors, and
fights as fair as the rest of us."
</p>

<p>
They halted their horses.  Beneath them, a little to
the right, was a group of cabins belonging to fisher
folk, smoke arising from the chimneys, telling of
warmth and crude comfort inside.  The boats of the
habitants, high drawn up, were securely fastened to
their moorings.
</p>

<p>
The wind roared and hissed and fumed.  The señora
and the Captain seemed not to heed it.  They were
looking, straight-eyed, out to the lashing sea whereon lay
their hopes and their fears.
</p>

<p>
"Captain, your friend Brown found his way to
Fairbanks's ship.  No?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Brown&mdash;tumbled&mdash;on board."
</p>

<p>
Their horses were side by side, yet Farquharson's
voice sounded muffled through the howling wind.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! tumbled.  Yes.  Still, he gained the Admiral's
ear.  No?"
</p>

<p>
"Fate threw the game in Brown's favor, and against us."
</p>

<p>
"Fate causes the daring one to win; the laggard, to
lose.  Is it not so?" raising her shoulders and waving
a hand, with the grace of the Latin and the art of a
beautiful woman.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of the air paused again.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, if you mean, by any chance, that I should
send a boat out, why, only a madman would go.
Besides Comandante Pacheco would permit no boat to
leave the presidio; and the alcalde would do the same for
Yerba Buena village."
</p>

<p>
Time passed.  The señora suddenly spurred her
horse.  The startled animal leaped forward.  "Come,
Captain, let us go to town," she called, already several
lengths ahead.
</p>

<p>
They rode persistently on till they reached a small
shed far down where they stopped for rest.
</p>

<p>
"Perdition on this inactivity!  If we could only do
something&mdash;anything to fill in the time in this dead
little hole."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Captain," in a detached voice.
</p>

<p>
"I have a suggestion.  My good hostess, Señora
Ramon, showed me yesterday a chess-board most
remarkable in workmanship, brought by the señor her
husband from Spain years ago.  They spend many
evenings over the game, she tells me.  Let us borrow
the board and its men and while away a few hours.
At least with these we can have the satisfaction of
planning&mdash;and executing&mdash;our own maneuvers.  I wish we
had done this before, instead of indulging in useless,
nerve-wracking vigils."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Captain, but I&mdash;I shall be otherwise
engaged this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"I understand, señora.  You do, truly, need a good
rest.  Excuse me for my thoughtlessness.  I know you
are worn out.  I believe, now that I think of it, I'll
follow your example, go to my quarters and turn in
for a time myself."
</p>

<p>
After partaking of a warm luncheon which her friend
Señora Aguirre had prepared, the señora went to her
room.  In the home of Señor Ramon, at the other end
of the village, the Captain settled himself for a siesta.
Not so the señora.  Tying her hair closely, she put on
a long, thick cloak which she carefully buttoned, placing
the hood on her head and well down over her ears;
lastly, a veil around her face.  Then she wrote a short
note.
</p>

<p>
Opening a window she dropped lightly to the ground,
keeping under the eaves till the rear of the house was
reached.  As swiftly as would a boy she ran to the stable
and ordered the sleepy groom to give her an untired
horse.  She was soon off, vying with the wind in speed,
ignoring, in her eagerness, both storm and cutting sand.
</p>

<p>
She came to the cabins near which she and the Captain
had been standing not two hours ago.  Taking the
first house at hand she unceremoniously opened the
door.  The surprised occupants, a man and woman,
with three nearly grown sons, started from various
attitudes of inertia and excitedly greeted the lady.
</p>

<p>
"Quick!  Quick!" she said.  "A boat at once!  I must
reach those ships out there before the night falls."
</p>

<p>
"Never, señora.  It would mean the life of anyone
attempting it."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  Come!  Let us be off!  Quick!" hastily
opening a small chamois bag.  Ten, twenty, thirty,
forty, fifty, one hundred dollars in gold she counted
out.  "It is all yours, if you will but come."
</p>

<p>
The youngest of the sons would do as she wished, if
the father and brothers would join.  They would not.
Yet she urged.  The wailing of the woman of the family
offset any progress she might have made with the men.
</p>

<p>
A large diamond ring which the señora always wore,
day or evening, gleamed insinuatingly into her eyes.
She caught its message.  Hastily removing it she held
it out:
</p>

<p>
"This and the gold, as well, shall be yours.  See, it
is worth a fortune.  Come, be quick!  A boat!"
</p>

<p>
"But we shall drown!  We shall drown!"
</p>

<p>
"I tell you no," and before they realized what they
were doing they were out of the house, the señora pulling
at the ropes which confined one of the largest of the
little cluster of vessels.
</p>

<p>
The boat was soon at the edge of the water.  The
señora jumped in.  The men, half dazed, followed.  They
bent to the oars, the señora's commands accompanied
by the weeping vociferations of the fisher-wife and
mother.  The other cabins had now emptied themselves,
and men, women, and children united in the hue and
cry.  It was too late.  Despite the handicap of wind
and wave the sturdy craft was well out, under the
compelling influence of the señora's determination.
</p>

<p>
Time after time they were on the verge of overturning.
Time after time huge billows challenged them.
Again, the men wearied almost to exhaustion, would
have given up the oars, to drift as they would, had
not the señora, her eyes flaming, threatened them with
all the terrors of an inferno; or as the mood
changed, pleading with them with the earnestness of a
Paul.
</p>

<p>
They passed the shadows of Point Lobos and fared
out across the bar to the open sea.  Here the storm
king's fury was at focus, the incoming and outgoing
seas forming a rip tide.  The boat twisted, pitched,
tossed; was flung around and around.  Wave upon wave
rolled over them.  By some trick of fortune they were
not hurled into the ocean.
</p>

<p>
The father and eldest son bent all their iron strength
to the oars; while the others baled out the boat with
might and main, the señora aiding energetically.
</p>

<p>
"Now, broad-backed father and mighty son, another
stroke, and another!"  With the incision of steel her
voice pierced the roar of the tempest, in words of
encouragement.  "Another stroke and we're head on
again.  Grande, hombres!  She's empty of water now,
and lighter to row.  Adelante!"
</p>

<p>
Slowly over surge and sea-trough they crawled.
</p>

<p>
Just as they appeared to be getting a little the best
of the situation a tremendous rush of water caught the
boat, whirled it about and bore it harborward at
terrific rate.  Before the storm it sped, back to the lea
of Point Lobos hills.  Here the fishermen regained
control.
</p>

<p>
"Madre de Dios!" exclaimed the father.  "Over in
one of those coves we'll find shelter where we can wait
a while, till we can get back home."
</p>

<p>
"Point Lobos arroyo is here.  We can land," said
one of the sons.
</p>

<p>
"Hombres, turn the boat and sail out to the ships,"
Señora Valentino spoke.
</p>

<p>
"No," from the father, decisively.  "Neither your
money nor your jewel can give life to the drowned."
</p>

<p>
"Father mine," from the youngest son, "why not go
out again?"
</p>

<p>
"Silly fool!  Go out and be food for fish?  No."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the youth is willing to face the dangers.  A
woman laughs at them.  Yet the most skilled boatman
of Yerba Buena is afraid!  A pretty story to be told
around the net mending on the beach.  A pretty story!
No?"
</p>

<p>
The man grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred other gold pesos, if you reach the
ships.  Why not be rich, enjoy life, and leave fishing to
others?"
</p>

<p>
The Mexican grunted again, "No."
</p>

<p>
"Turn about.  I warn you," resolution burning her
words.
</p>

<p>
"No, I shall not.  Death awaits if I do."
</p>

<p>
Her hand rose suddenly.  The man looked into the
barrel of a pistol which the señora pointed steadily at
him.  "Death awaits, if you do not!"
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" growled the father, "your powder's wet and
your pistol good for nothing.  You can't fool me."
</p>

<p>
She fired the pistol into the air; drew a second weapon
from beneath her cloak and pointed it in level aim.
</p>

<p>
"The next shot will not go wild.  Turn back, I say;
else I crook my finger, ever so slightly, and you die, a
coward!  Your name a byword among fishermen!"
</p>

<p>
The man said nothing.  Pride, and desire of gain
spoke urgently; but, he knew the temper of an angry
sea.  On the other hand&mdash;that pistol barrel glinting so
unpleasantly; and the eye of the señora&mdash;darkening&mdash;threatening.
What a will that white woman has!  Her
hand was tightening&mdash;her finger beginning to press the
trigger.
</p>

<p>
"Out to sea, boys!" he cried, suddenly, gripping the
oars.  "Get to work with your paddles.  All together!
Now!"
</p>

<p>
Once more they made the bar.  The wind had veered
from west to north.  A tiny sail, close-reefed, was
raised.  The boat flew southward along the coast, just
outside the whitening edge of breakers.  The fleet lay
to the right, but their only hope of reaching the flagship
was not in direct course, but in wide sweep out to sea,
then to circle back toward the west.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon wore away.  The sun dipped below the
water's edge.  Leagues out of sight of either land or
warships had they come.
</p>

<p>
The sail was reefed yet closer.  Father and sons
tugged on the tiller rope.  The rudder, square across
the course, brought the boat head to wind which was
again blowing westward.
</p>

<p>
The little craft cavorted like a bucking broncho; then
wheeled, and dashed homeward again.  A sudden gust
tore her canvas from its cordage.  The men sprang to
the oars, and mightily fought the sea until the boat was
once more in the teeth of the gale.
</p>

<p>
They were in their element now.  Many a night had
these fishermen lain out on the sea when unforeseen
storm made entering the harbor perilous.  Crossing the
bar against an ocean's fury was one thing; to toss, boat
to windward, safe from treacherous rocks, for a night
or longer, was quite another matter.
</p>

<p>
"Señora," spoke the father, "with our sail we could
have reached your ships by time of dark.  We cannot
with the oars.  There's nothing to do but lie here.  When
morning comes we'll row you to where you wish to go."
</p>

<p>
The stars crept out and kept watch over the heaving
craft.  The waves hurled spray against the backs of the
oarsmen, of which they took no notice, except as the
father would occasionally direct one of his sons to bale
out the water.
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino, who had sat for hours through
repeated drenchings, shook with the cold.  She was
in the stern of the boat facing the others.  Through
the dimness they saw her crouching, elbows on knees,
her body quivering, her teeth chattering.
</p>

<p>
Their rude chivalry awoke.  The father spoke to one
of the sons, who searched in the locker till he found a
skin which had been rubbed over with seal oil.  The
lady wrapped herself in it.
</p>

<p>
The storm abated, and the cold increased
correspondingly.  The señora drew the coat more tightly
about her.  After a while she slept.
</p>

<p>
The fishermen began talking in low tones.
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred pesos," from the eldest son, "besides
the one hundred in hand!  We can buy the store of
Manuel Lopez, and sell the fish that others catch."
</p>

<p>
"Five hundred pesos," from the youngest.  "Is there
that much money in the world?  I wonder why the
señora is so anxious to get on board the ships?"
</p>

<p>
"Past finding out are the ways of white people," the
father replied.  "Long have I ceased to try to
understand them."
</p>

<p>
"I think," the boy continued, "that she must have
a lover there."
</p>

<p>
"Quién sabe?  If it is a lover I'll think he'll find she
possesses spirit.  Santa Maria!  If all women had half
as much, children, I'd bid you never marry."
</p>

<p>
"She is most generous with money," in way of defense
from the second son.
</p>

<p>
"Money flies into the Spaniard's pocket, and out
again.  They care nothing for it.  But this one,"
nodding to the sleeping woman, "would have killed us
to-day if she had not been given her way."
</p>

<p>
"We've been calling her 'señora.'  I believe we should
have said 'señorita,'" came from the eldest son.
</p>

<p>
"I think so too; and I'm sure it's her lover she
is going to meet out there," returned the youngest
son.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, she's very young, and very handsome."
</p>

<p>
"Handsome is that handsome does," retorted the
father.
</p>

<p>
"But she makes our fortune for us; and she took the
risk in coming here the same as we," reminded the
middle son.
</p>

<p>
The wind spent itself finally in a few rampant whirls.
The boat commenced to rock in even motion.  The boys
worked industriously with the baling pails.
</p>

<p>
The father took from the locker two or three fishnets.
These he bunched together and placed on the bottom
of the vessel near where the lady was sitting.  He
touched her on the shoulder.  "Awake, señora.  The
wind has gone down, and we'll no longer ship water.
I've made you quite a good bed from these fishnets.
You can lie here and sleep till morning."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, hombre," as she snuggled down on the
improvised bed.
</p>

<p>
"We usually have aguardiente, but none's left in the
locker this trip.  Only by chance did we have that coat
you're wearing."
</p>

<p>
"I'm very comfortable, I shall be as warm as if I
were at home in my own room," she laughed.  "Thank
you, again, very, very much."
</p>

<p>
"These summer nights pass quickly.  It is morning
before we know."
</p>

<p>
Hers was the sleep of exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
The rattle of oars in rowlocks awakened her.  The
men were no longer merely holding to the wind, but were
pulling vigorously.  She felt the boat urge forward
with each stroke.  She raised herself a little and looked
over the gunwale.  There was darkness everywhere, save
when the starlight flashed thinly on some wave-roof.
</p>

<p>
"A good part of the night is spent, lady," the father
said.  "The currents begin to run as usual, now that
the storm is past.  I'm beating to the windward of your
ships.  You may as well go back to sleep."
</p>

<p>
After two hours or so he called to her.  "Which ship
is it that you want, señora?"
</p>

<p>
She looked about.  Morning had come.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the reenforcements are here," to herself.  "Our
Admiral has now eleven men-of-war."  Then to the boatman:
"That vessel on the left, the large one flying two
flags.  Sabe?"
</p>

<p>
"Si, señora."
</p>

<p>
The Mexicans plied their oars yet more diligently.
</p>

<p>
Miles slipped away.
</p>

<p>
"Boat, ahoy!" called the lookout on the flagship.
</p>

<p>
"Ship, ahoy!" in reply from the señora.  "I'm coming
on board with a message for the Admiral."
</p>

<p>
Without warning a fragment of storm-beaten sea,
tearing toward the harbor, caught alike fisher-boat and
man-of-war.
</p>

<p>
"Fend off, men!  Fend off!  Our suction'll swamp
you," shouted the lookout to the fishermen.
</p>

<p>
Oars were useless against the onrush.
</p>

<p>
The leaning masts of the warship overhung the struggling
fisher-boat, wheeled upward, then away.  Into the
maelstrom drew the little craft.  Sailors under hurried
orders scurried about the decks of the listing man-of-war.
Ropes whisked over the sides down to the water
which was overclouded by foam and spray.
</p>

<p>
"The little chap's sunk!" sounded from the man-of-war.
</p>

<p>
"No, she ain't.  'Ere's a taut rope.  Belike she's
fast."
</p>

<p>
Figures clinging to the boat, upturned, were bobbing
about in the settling mist.
</p>

<p>
"She's fast to our line, nose aloft like a hooked fish!"
from the decks.
</p>

<p>
"There's a H'english girl on board!" shouted the
look out.  "Didn't ye 'ear 'er yell?"
</p>

<p>
Sailors, ropes knotted under their arms, were
dropped to the sea by their fellows.
</p>

<p>
"Them's Mexicans," sputtered a big salt rolling over
the taffrail with his burden.  "I've a Mex. kid 'ere, I
fancy."
</p>

<p>
An elderly man, uniform gold-braided and gold-laced,
came up.
</p>

<p>
The supposed Mexican lad threw off the enveloping
folds of the oiled coat.  Jauntily, hand raised as if in
salute, Señora Valentino stepped forth, apparently as
fresh as ever in her life, despite her dripping and
clinging garments.
</p>

<p>
"Come on board, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"My God!  Señora Valentino!"
</p>

<p>
"At your service, Admiral Fairbanks," with an
exaggerated curtsy.
</p>

<p>
Sailors and marines backed away.
</p>

<p>
"Madam, what has happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Too little, sir.  Much must happen, and at once,"
her eyes holding his.
</p>

<p>
"First, hot blankets and the doctor's draughts, good
lady."
</p>

<p>
"I require neither.  A change of clothing would be
acceptable, but&mdash;&mdash;" lifting her hands deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Not so impossible as you might think.  The cabin
that was my wife's will supply your needs, I'm sure.
She left her keys with me when she went ashore at the
Cape.  The dispatch-boat which sent me flying here at
an hour's notice left her no time to get her belongings.
When you have made ready we'll confer; that is, after
you have seen Doctor Bartlett."
</p>

<p class="thought">
******
<br />
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino," the Admiral had broken in,
"Mr. Blair, our chaplain, the man of many tongues,
learned from the men with you your experiences of
yesterday and last night."
</p>

<p>
"So, señor?"
</p>

<p>
"The risk you took in coming to me speaks better
your conviction that I should take Monterey than could
any word of yours.  But, why has Colonel Mendoza
not been mentioned to me either by you or Captain
Farquharson?  Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza speaks much these days of
democracy and fair play.  Yet, both democracy and fair play
demand that the minority accepts the decision of the
majority.  Why should we have mentioned Mendoza?
He stands almost alone.  As to Governor Barcelo&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not speak to me of Governor Barcelo!  Only
by threats of summary court-martial did I prevent my
captains from bombarding the capital the other
day."  The Admiral sprang excitedly from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a moment, Admiral, if you will."
</p>

<p>
He was again seated.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Barcelo sends word to you through me that
he has satisfied his honor, and that you are at liberty
to occupy Monterey, for all of him.  He has taken all
his troopers to his hacienda eight leagues away in the
country."
</p>

<p>
"When he fired on me, then, it was merely by way
of shotted salute?" in sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing more, practically."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, a world war might easily start here."
</p>

<p>
"Admiral, a world peace might begin here at your
word.  The United States cares nothing for this
territory.  Two vessels only have they&mdash;worn and old&mdash;in
their Pacific squadron.  They even call their flagship
'the lumber wagon,' by way of jesting.  California is the
balance weight of Texas and Oregon.  The province
calls to you.  Peace calls to you.  Else the future sees
dispute and war over province and empire treasure-trove.
</p>

<p>
"Admiral Fairbanks, this is the hour, and you are the
man.  If you fail, and, later, the shadows of war
darken these shores, then must you answer at the bar
of conscience and humanity.  I have risked my own life,
and forced the poor Mexicans with me to risk theirs,
that I might plead with you."
</p>

<p>
The commander looked earnestly at the woman.
</p>

<p>
"Admiral, consider the tremendous potentialities that
await your inaction."
</p>

<p>
He studied the floor in deep thought.
</p>

<p>
"Now is the supreme moment, Admiral Fairbanks."
</p>

<p>
The Admiral arose, looked out the window, walked
back to his desk, put his hands in his pocket, then
clasped them behind him; once more went to the window,
and back again; took a speaking-tube off its hook.
"How are those Mexicans getting along in the cockpit,
Doctor?  Good.  Have they breakfasted?  Each one
enough for three, you say?  Good."
</p>

<p>
He sat quiet a moment.  Arising, he came in front of
the señora, lines of firmness marking his face.
</p>

<p>
"Too many times have the shadows of war darkened
our world history.  Her gracious Majesty, our young
Queen Victoria, ever counsels to work in the interest
of peace.  Never have I had wish other than this.
Señora Valentino, what you say strikes home.  I shall
invest Monterey to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
A marine rapped at the door.  He saluted and gave
a message.
</p>

<p>
"The Calliope signals that Padre Osuna wishes to
speak with Admiral Fairbanks."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! she must have picked up the padre at San
Diego," from the señora.  "The high wind has returned
him north in double-quick time."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go on deck, señora.  The Calliope and three
others came up coast last night and knew us by our
lights."
</p>

<p>
A ship's boat was approaching bearing the Franciscan.
As it swung under the bow of the flagship the
friar seized a rope and, hand over hand, as adept as a
sailor, he reached the side of the señora and the Admiral.
</p>

<p>
After a few words of greeting the padre, noting
Señora Valentino's questioning look, announced: "I
have traveled from Monterey to San Diego.  The southland
is crying aloud for English rule," directing his
words to the Admiral.
</p>

<p>
"In the interest of peace, Padre Osuna, I shall take
Monterey to-morrow," from Fairbanks.
</p>

<p>
After a few minutes in conversation the señora said:
"Señora Padre, I have boat and men here," pointing
to the place where the Mexicans were sitting on their
inverted craft.  "Will you not go with me to Yerba
Buena?"
</p>

<p>
"I will, señora, and my thanks are yours."
</p>

<p>
Sailors raised the boat on davits and lowered it to
the water.  The fishermen joyfully turned home, the
padre and the señora conversing quietly in the stern.
</p>

<p>
"That bloomin' Mexican has a lot o' money bulgin'
under 'is belt," one tar remarked to another, as they
watched the fish-boat making for shore.
</p>

<p>
"Haw!  haw!  haw!" laughed a third.  "You should
'a seen Dickie this mornin'.  Somebody sings out,
'There's a H'english gal aboard.'  'No such thing,'
says Dickie, comin' over the side and spittin' water like
a sperm w'ale, 'they're h'all black Mex., an' 'e a 'oldin'
the purtiest w'ite gal I ever see h'all the time.
Haw! haw!" slapping Dickie's shoulder.  Then, in different
tones: "Admiral's signalin' a-plenty.  Wonder w'at
h'it's all about."
</p>

<p>
The señora, the padre and the Mexicans made Yerba
Buena safely, and found the little town in uproar over
the astounding escapade of a señora who had persuaded
good, sane fishermen to go with her to sure death.
</p>

<p>
Father and sons escaped from congratulating friends
to the seclusion of their cot where, with the mother, they
rejoiced over their good fortune.  Not only were they
safe after an experience over which Yerba Buena was
to talk for a decade, but that most wealthy señor the
ships' treasurer had given each ten gold sovereigns for
himself, besides paying the sire the one hundred
sovereigns promised by the señora.
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino was indefatigable as well as intrepid.
Soon, with the friar and Farquharson, she was
dashing on horseback down the peninsula toward Monterey.
</p>

<p>
"So you read my note to Señora Aguirre," she remarked
to Farquharson.
</p>

<p>
"I did, and learned of your purpose to go out to the
fleet.  Finding at the Mexican settlement that you had
actually put this purpose into effect I got a boat and
was just pushing off to follow you when a provost
marshal placed me under arrest.  Confound him! as if I
didn't have a right to do as I pleased, stormy or not!
And that blasted comandante held me at the presidio
till your return."
</p>

<p>
"Then you also were coming to the flagship?  No?"
</p>

<p>
"Señora, I never dreamed you would think of such a
thing as going out there by yourself.  I've never felt so
small in my life.  It would be a relief if I was lying at
the bottom of the harbor."
</p>

<p>
"Not so, Captain.  It was a mad thing, my venturing
forth; but, you know, when a woman wills she will.  So,
no fault in you, Captain mine.  Pray think no more of
it.  As we ride along I'll tell you more of my meeting
with Fairbanks after I&mdash;tumbled on board his vessel."
</p>

<p>
They reached the high ground near the Laguna de
las Mercedes, two leagues beyond Mission Dolores.  A
deep-voiced exclamation from Padre Osuna, accompanied
by a full-arm gesture, directed their attention to
the right.  The ocean, as if making amends for violent
temper of the past days, lay in unruffled mood before
them.  The eleven vessels of the fleet, spread white
against sapphire arc, were sailing to the south.
</p>

<p>
Farquharson's eyes, an admiring light in them,
sought the señora.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, Fairbanks is really going to Monterey!"
</p>

<p>
She inclined her head.
</p>

<p>
"You are a wonderful woman.  I have said this
before.  I say it now with double emphasis."
</p>

<p>
The three halted and watched the fleet.
</p>

<p>
"Come, let us ride on," from the señora, impatient at
delay.
</p>

<p>
"Well," remarked Farquharson, "Barcelo has spiked
the castle guns, and skedaddled.  The Yankee's flagship
is stuck in the mud, with her consort, the Cyane.  I
wonder what the deuce will keep that old dunderhead,
Fairbanks out of Monterey now!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br />
BUT YET A WOMAN
</h3>

<p>
Fog everywhere.  Congealed fog dripped from the
roofs of Monterey.  It fell, drop, drop, drop, in
elongated pearls, on the slippery flag walks around the
houses.  Mountains of fog lay over the city, and slid
in huge avalanches into the valleys.  The harbor and
near-about sea were filled with vapor-hills and crags.
Fog blanketed the streets, blurred the trees, blotted the
symmetry of buildings into bewildering shapelessness,
and peopled the town with weird specters.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally a candle-point showed feebly in a corner
lamp.  Once in a while the dimness was accentuated
by a lighted space streaking a yellowish gleam into the
semiopaqueness&mdash;the candle of some early-rising
Montereyan shining from his window.  There were few of
these lights to aid the passer-by; and there were few
passers-by.  Not only was the hour early for the people
to be about, but the city itself was almost tenantless.
</p>

<p>
It was the beginning of the fifth day since the English
fleet had sailed into Monterey, and out again.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo, with his soldiers, had marched away
to Alisal, the colors from the fort and from the square
emblazoned at the head of his column.  After him rode
the most of the wealth and fashion of the capital; that
is, the most of those who had not preceded him.
</p>

<p>
The Colonel declared that he had satisfied honor,
and that he would now retire in face of superior force.
</p>

<p>
Calmness of weather had succeeded wind-storm; still
the fort slept peacefully beneath the empty flagpole,
and the city plaza caught no shadow of foreign banner
floating from the lofty staff in its center.
</p>

<p>
A horseman rode into town, made his way hurriedly
through the plaza and crossed to a smaller plaza.  He
drew in sharply when he reached a house in which a
light was showing through the railing of a veranda on
the second story.  He turned into the porte cochere.
A vague figure was heaped across the threshold of the
front door.
</p>

<p>
"Ola!  Ola!  Benito!" called the rider.
</p>

<p>
The figure resolved itself into a man wrapped in a
blanket.  Turtlelike his head emerged from its folds.
</p>

<p>
"Benito is with Colonel Barcelo.  I am Alberto, peon
of Señor Miramonte."
</p>

<p>
"Has Señora Valentino returned to the capital?  Do
you know?"
</p>

<p>
"The señora returned last night, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Is she within?"
</p>

<p>
"She is not, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
"She's away, señor."
</p>

<p>
The man loosened rein and started down the street.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Farquharson," called the peon, in tardy
recognition.
</p>

<p>
"Many pardons, but may I make free to speak?
The señora brought my wife, Lupincha, and me along
as servants, since she heard the Barcelo place is vacant.
Señora Miramonte lent us.  May I say, Captain, my
lady has taken Lupincha with her and, attended by a
peon guard, is now at the castle, leaving an hour ago?"
</p>

<p>
"At the castle?  An hour ago?"
</p>

<p>
"Si, Señor Captain.  Breakfast is to be served there."
</p>

<p>
"Breakfast&mdash;at the castle!" the man speaking half to
himself, and as if perplexed.
</p>

<p>
Alberto arose, huddled his blanket more closely about
his shoulders, and came to the rider.  "Several señoras
and señors will be at the meal," he said in a low voice.
In yet lower tone he added: "They are there to see
the arrival of the English, and the defeat of the gringos
Americanos&mdash;the Bostons."  Bowing obsequiously, he
glided over to his place on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino and friends are now at the castle,
you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Si, señor."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson galloped back to the city plaza.  He
paused for a moment.  The horse was restless in the
chilly air.  Its shod hoofs, clattering on the pavement,
struck showers of sparks.  He rode on a few steps, and
stopped again, listening intently.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis only the boom of the surf," and started out
briskly for the castle.  On arriving he saw light coming
through the windows, and heard the voices and laughter
of men and women.  Two or three peons bearing baskets
appeared at the postern.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to speak with Señora Valentino.  Tell her
Captain Farquharson is here."
</p>

<p>
The señora soon was at the door.
</p>

<p>
"I'm here, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"Barcelo's in the sulks."
</p>

<p>
"As I expected."
</p>

<p>
"As to his giving the right hand of fellowship to
Fairbanks, that is not to be thought of."
</p>

<p>
"Again, as I expected."
</p>

<p>
"When I saw him he was as savage as a caged bear."
</p>

<p>
The señora nodded her head meditatively.
</p>

<p>
"It's well the cannon are spiked."
</p>

<p>
"They have been unspiked.  Some one has drilled out
the priming tubes."
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean it, señora!"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
"My hat!  It's enough to drive one mad."
</p>

<p>
"Last night, about midnight, I heard Fairbanks off
Point Pinos signaling the other vessels in his fleet; so
he's near at hand, and I've got together a little
company to welcome him."
</p>

<p>
"To think that this of all days should see such
blooming fog.  If 'twould only clear up so the
Admiral could get in, it would end all this fuss.  But,
something must be done about Barcelo.  Some of these
men hereabouts are talking more and more in favor of
a California republic.  Their nonsense has evidently got
into the Colonel's system."
</p>

<p>
"And disappointed ambition might have another
chance if such a republic came into being.  My
brother-in-law has a good deal of the bulldog in him."
</p>

<p>
"I am willing to believe almost anything of him now.
But we've got to get to work; otherwise he'll be down
here, likely as not, blowing off his fireworks again."
</p>

<p>
"Have you a suggestion, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I've thought till I can't think any longer.  In
the first place, I can't do anything with him; and it's
too far for you to go out there.  In the second
place&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It will be best for me to be here when Fairbanks
comes.  When he once gets in we must take him by the
hand and keep him here."
</p>

<p>
"We are in a deuce of a fix, between the devil and
the deep sea, so to speak.  On one hand, Barcelo, sulky
and savage, and threatening to blow the British fleet off
the map.  On the other hand, Fairbanks so scrupulous
he's ready to throw the gifts of the gods back into their
arms, at the slightest excuse.  When I left you yesterday
at Miramonte's I hurried south to run down rumors.
I've caught up with the rumors but haven't
accomplished anything else.  I have men watching
Barcelo's movements.  What else to do I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain, let's do nothing for the present&mdash;since
there's nothing to be done."
</p>

<p>
"If this accursed fog would only lift."
</p>

<p>
"Our standing here won't lift it.  Come in and breakfast
with us."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, but I want to go back to the hills to
see if the sentinels have possibly caught sight of the
fleet through some rift in the fog-banks."
</p>

<p>
"The fleet is off the harbor all right, my friend.
What matter whether you see it or not?  You will do
better for having had refreshment."
</p>

<p>
"Not now.  Perhaps I'll return later.  I haven't yet
inquired how you are.  How is it with you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am all right, thank you.  I could ride to Alisal."
</p>

<p>
"But you cannot be spared from here when the fog
lifts.  Talk about a California republic!  Señora, you
should be ruler of the Californias, including Texas and
Oregon."
</p>

<p>
"Captain!  Captain!" her merry laugh sounding
within the old castle.  "Again, my friend, breakfast.
Hot coffee will go well, I am sure."
</p>

<p>
"You are very good, but I will decline for the present.
Good-bye for a while.  If anything comes up, I'll let
you know.  By the way, why not make Barcelo governor
and general?  Morando says he won't have the office,
anyway, and it might save no end of confusion."
</p>

<p>
"Don't think it.  It would only add fuel to the flame.
Crisostimo's pride would be seriously touched at being
made second choice.  Besides, he isn't the man for the
place, and the home office would justly blame us.  He
has been a brave and efficient fighting soldier, but never
could be executive or diplomatic."
</p>

<p>
Rider and horse were soon lost to sight.
</p>

<p>
The señora returned to her friends.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast was served immediately.  A table had been
made ready in the old armory.  Vacant musket racks
and empty ammunition boxes were strange adornment
for a breakfast, the room itself cobwebbed and dusty.
Sperm-oil lanterns furnished needed light.
</p>

<p>
Peons served coffee and tortillas, accompanied by
sea-trout browned to a turn over charcoal.  This was
followed with a delicious dish made of chicken and
green corn boiled together, and the inevitable frijoles.
Strawberries, large and luscious, which had been soaked
in Mission wine, were plentifully distributed at each
plate, of which the breakfasters partook at intervals
throughout the meal, eating the fruit from the stem.
Fresh figs stewed in sherry completed the repast.
</p>

<p>
There was little conversation in this company made
up of individuals usually vivacious and talkative.  The
tenseness of eager expectation held everyone quiet.
</p>

<p>
The meal was not much more than finished when Captain
Farquharson entered the room unannounced.  The
men and women sprang up.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino," the Captain called.
</p>

<p>
She stepped to his side.
</p>

<p>
"My scouts have rushed word to me that Barcelo has
left Alisal and is stampeding to Monterey."
</p>

<p>
"What is that you say, Captain?" from the señora,
incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Barcelo is but a few miles from the outskirts of
town, saying he is going to proclaim himself dictator of
a California republic, and calling down vengeance on
anyone opposing.  The fat's in the fire if Fairbanks
gets wind of this."
</p>

<p>
"I must ride at once and meet the Colonel."
</p>

<p>
"Would that I could meet him with my old company
in the Coldstream Guards!  Bull-dog or no, he'd not
forget the hour.  I'll go along with you, señora, but
it's precious little that anyone can do with such a
man."
</p>

<p>
After requesting those present to await her return,
the señora mounted her horse and rode rapidly toward
El Camino Real, Farquharson riding with her as far
as the city limits, when she said to him:
</p>

<p>
"I will go on now by myself, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"As you wish.  I'll stay here, then, till you come
back."
</p>

<p>
Time dragged.
</p>

<p>
Captain Farquharson dismounted and nervously led
his animal back and forth.
</p>

<p>
An hour passed, and yet another.  Still the Captain
was at his post.  For the hundredth time he fiercely
drew his watch from his pocket, scowled at its face and
as fiercely thrust it back.
</p>

<p>
In sudden desperation the man sprang to horse.
With two fingers on his lips he began a whistle-call, but
stopped abruptly.  The señora had emerged from the
fog.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, long ago I sent men to see if you
were safe.  They reported that you and Barcelo were
riding up and down an outer street talking, talking,
talking.  You have been in conference with him over
two hours.  Of course nothing could be done with him."
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Barcelo has gone home, after sending his
men to the barracks.  When Fairbanks comes the Colonel
will turn the government over to him formally, and
give him the right hand of fellowship."
</p>

<p>
"How did you manage?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"By making appeal both to his less worthy nature
and to his higher."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"First, by arousing jealousy, convincing him that a
California republic would surely make Mendoza its
president.  Second, in appealing to his nobler side.  I
said to him that a California republic would mean
internecine strife&mdash;Monterey, the brain and heart of the
province, fighting the north and the south, its hands
and feet.  So between the two arguments the cause was
won."
</p>

<p>
"You actually induced him to go home?"
</p>

<p>
"He has gone," smiling.  "Sister Clarinda aided me,
a wife's influence, you know."
</p>

<p>
Farquharson wrinkled his forehead knowingly.
</p>

<p>
Together they returned to the castle.  The little knot
of people anxiously gathered around them.  To their
excited questionings the señora replied: "All's well
that ends well."
</p>

<p>
"Your meaning, señora?" asked one.
</p>

<p>
"That we've nothing to do now&mdash;but disperse the
fog."
</p>

<p>
Señora Valentino went to an upper corner of the
castle, and into a room now seldom used.  It had once
been a sentinel chamber, and surveyed harbor and sea.
More than once had she come to this place, time
permitting, to revel in its loneliness.
</p>

<p>
To-day the fog drew dark shades over the windows,
enveloping the room in twilight.  A slow wind was
blowing, enough to move the casements.  This augured
well.  Afternoon would, more than likely, see clear
skyline.
</p>

<p>
The woman's mood was to be alone.  Closing the old
door on its rusty hinges she turned the grating lock,
and looked around with a sigh of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
The former governor had been an intimate of this
room.  Here he would steal away to read and dream.
The furnishings were his, and he had not seen fit to
disturb them when leaving for Mexico.  On shelves
were books of poems and romances.  On the floor lay
rugs of tasteful pattern and coloring.  A few very good
pictures were on the wall, while an easy chair or two
stood invitingly.  On one side jutted a stone fireplace,
a pile of ashes on the hearth telling its own story.  All
these things were strangely out of keeping with the
rest of the castle.
</p>

<p>
In a cupboard the señora found wood and paper in
abundance, placed there by the former governor, mindful
of his comfort.
</p>

<p>
"I'm cold," she shivered.  "I'll call Lupincha and
have a fire.  No, I'll build it myself."
</p>

<p>
The dry fuel and the paper, ignited by a flint spark,
soon made flames that roared into the chimney.
</p>

<p>
"Now it is cheery and warm.  I'll look over one of
Governor Moncada's romances till the fleet enters.
Well, here's Don Quixote.  He won't do&mdash;I've fought
windmills myself&mdash;it's monotonous.  And here, El Cid.
Not to-day&mdash;more heroics.  I want a book written
about life as it is, not as it ought to be."
</p>

<p>
She took up a manuscript, "Ode to Falling Rain,"
by the Governor himself.
</p>

<p>
"Señor Moncada, why was it not an 'Ode to a Lifting
Fog'?  Because it is not, into the fire you go, you
wrinkled bit of paper.  Ah! it burns well despite the
title.  My brother-in-law once spoke of the governor
as a fussy old curmudgeon.  It would be interesting to
know what the Señora Moncada thinks of the Señor
Barcelo."
</p>

<p>
A knock interrupted her musing.  She kept perfectly
quiet.  Again, the knock, a little louder, a little more
insistent.  She snuggled closer into the chair.  Suddenly
the thought came to her that it might be Farquharson
with some message of importance.  She quickly unlocked
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, may I come in?  The peona
Lupincha told me I would find you here."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Captain Morando, come in.  My friends
in the castle are variously occupying themselves till the
great moment strikes.  I," looking around, "chose to
come off here by myself," her manner charmingly cordial.
</p>

<p>
The señora was again in her chair.  The comandante
sat opposite.  There was silence, each seeming to find
nothing to say to the other.
</p>

<p>
Under the firelight the doña appeared more beautiful
than ever, her form unusually petite and girlish.  To
the soldier she had been a piece of exquisite workmanship,
cameo-cut, a rare jewel to be admired.  To-day
she was this, plus woman's sweetness and gentleness.
His heart gave an appreciative throb.
</p>

<p>
"Silvia," abruptly, "will you be my wife?"
</p>

<p>
She flashed her eyes at him.  "Captain, it is curious,
isn't it? about most people.  They roll along in their
groove, at about the same speed, and reach a certain
point at a certain time, regularly enough.  Have you
ever thought of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, no&mdash;or, perhaps, yes."
</p>

<p>
"In the old stories the chapters end with the proposal,
the puppets are disposed of, the book closed.  You
have, then, reached this point?"
</p>

<p>
"But, Silvia, you and I have been so frank that
nothing preliminary seemed left for me to say&mdash;if that is
what you mean&mdash;so I asked the question as I did.  I
vow to you by my manhood&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She stood before him.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Morando, it was love for an ideal man that
really brought me to California."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, I did not know&mdash;&mdash;" also rising.
</p>

<p>
"No.  You did not know," her lips hardening ever so
little.  "Yes, an ideal.  Him I love with my heart, my
soul; every energy I have.  Gladly would I live for him.
Equally gladly would I die for him."
</p>

<p>
"Then, señora, there is no room in your life for me?
Another fills it?  Why, I thought&mdash;I believed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You thought!  you believed!  O, Alfredo!"
</p>

<p>
"You have never cared for me.  You never can care.
You&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not trouble either of us with further questioning.
I answer, No, I do not care for you&mdash;have never
cared for you."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, even but now I dared think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Dare think nothing!"
</p>

<p>
"Then, Doña Silvia, I erred, that is all.  My intentions
were worthy.  You never intimated to me anything
of this&mdash;this affection.  I step out of the way of this
other whom you so fully love.  May you be happy,
and may he endow your life with all joy.  I leave you
now."
</p>

<p>
"No, Alfredo, not yet," her voice shaking a little.
"Do you not know who it is that has impersonated my
ideal?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I do not know."
</p>

<p>
"And can you not even conjecture?" a little wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"How could I?"
</p>

<p>
"You are right.  How could you?" with an enigmatic
smile.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with a penetratingly appraising
gaze.
</p>

<p>
"I will enlighten you.  It is you&mdash;you&mdash;Señor Captain
Morando&mdash;you!"
</p>

<p>
"I?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I tried to cheat myself.  I lied to myself about
you.  I kept you on a pedestal for my worshiping.
You, Captain Morando, are nothing to me, but the
man, the ideal man, whom I hoped was inclosed in that
goodly form of yours, he it is whom I love."  Her tones
were low and even.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, it is to me a regret that your ideal has been
so misplaced."
</p>

<p>
"It is but one more link in that chain of
disillusionment&mdash;my life.  I suppose I should not complain.
What does it matter?"  Her words betokened a resignation
which her glowing eyes did not verify.
</p>

<p>
The Captain moved his chair closer to her and took
her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, though disillusionment has passed me by,
disappointment has not.  Let us make common cause,
and fight the battle of life together.  Wounds quiver
and smart in the past of both of us.  Why not let the
future in years of devotion each to the other, bring
consoling balm to these wounds?"
</p>

<p>
Her hand remained in his, but she did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Señora&mdash;Silvia&mdash;let us go away from here, and, in
the quiet of home life, let time do its work in scattering
into forgetfulness the ashes of old heartburnings."
</p>

<p>
"And what of my lost ideal, Alfredo?"
</p>

<p>
"Señora doña, theory is one thing, fact another;
and life is fact.  Why not accept things as they
are?"
</p>

<p>
"Many would say you speak well.  And yet&mdash;rather
than sacrifice my ideal would I choose to sleep forever
at the bottom of the sea."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, do you believe that ideals are ever realized
in this world?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not.  But, to come from abstract thought
to concrete application.  When the señorita of the
window pane looked down on the parade ground facing
old Pilar Convent the place widened into fields of
conquest.  The flashing sword in the hand of her
cadet-officer became a marshal's baton, the sword-belt, a
viceroy's sash.  Her eaglet would fly straight-winged
into the face of the sun.  Though storms above the
clouds might whirl him like a dried and broken branch,
and hurl him back to earth, yet ever upward would be
his purpose.  Don Alfredo, have you ever tried your
wings?  Don't speak, soldier.  I will answer for you.
Like the pet chick, pinions folded, have you been content
with hopping fences&mdash;the eaglet-cadet a village
comandante."
</p>

<p>
"I am fulfilling my duty to the best of my ability."
</p>

<p>
She drew her hand away, and looked him squarely in
the face.
</p>

<p>
"Fulfilling duty!  Alfredo, you exhaust my patience.
I have power; I have influence, I have standing at the
court of Saint James.  Under Lord Aberdeen's written
promise to me, would he make high place for you in
Europe, or in vast India.  You yawned.  My offer was
unconsidered.
</p>

<p>
"A strange contempt for opportunity seems ever to
have been your make-up.  As in manhood, so in your
youth.  Alfredo, during those three years at Pilar you
blew a kiss to me from the parade ground; or, was it
twice? or, perhaps thrice? or, even more.  A valiant
conquistador-in-the-making, disregarding barrier,
would have reached the topmost span of that forbidding
cloister, to salute the lips of the watching maiden at
closer range than fifty paces.
</p>

<p>
"But to return to later times.  If Britain possesses
California, a viceroyship must go to some one.  You
shrugged when I spoke of tossing it to you; yet, it is
a catch for which many an ambitious caballero would
stretch ready hands."
</p>

<p>
"I am not ambition's fool, neither am I without
ambition.  If I rise, my own feet shall lift me, step by
step," in his voice a ring of challenge.
</p>

<p>
"In other words, you prefer to protect the flocks of
rich herdsmen against marauding aborigine&mdash;if not
in California, elsewhere.  No?"
</p>

<p>
"Silvia, let us cease this exchange of words.  We have
much in common.  Come with me.  Be my household
queen.  In coming here to-day not the least in my
thought was the wish to take you away from the politics
of the world.  Come, Silvia, come."
</p>

<p>
"And, over there&mdash;in the distance&mdash;beyond the
shadows&mdash;would be my ideal calling to me, chiding me,
telling me of my unfaithfulness.  No, Alfredo, I lie to
myself no longer.
</p>

<p>
"The other morning, as I left your official sitting
room in San José, the King's Highway to Monterey
became another road to Damascus.  The scales fell
from my eyes, as they did from Saul of Tarsus.  I
cursed myself for the lie to which I had sworn in the
sanctuary of my soul&mdash;the lie making you, Alfredo
Morando, the personification of my ideal.
</p>

<p>
"I lashed my horse.  I wished&mdash;I even prayed&mdash;that
the beast might spring to the rocky depths of the cañon
at my side, that I might find release in the parting
of my body and its soul."
</p>

<p>
"Señora Valentino, the artist sometimes so arranges
the lights and shades on his sitter that he brings in
relief certain lineaments to the obscuring of others,
producing, often, a fancy picture rather than a
portrait.  Your delineation of my character, emphasizing
certain points, neglecting others, seems to be hardly
fair.  But, doña, I scorn the pleader's place.  I admit
my unworthiness.  Your word, then&mdash;is final?" arising
and taking up his cap, dignity vesting speech and
manner.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Alfredo, final&mdash;final.  Go, continue to be a
comandante-protector of sheep.  Gallop across the
plains to Mission San José.  Improvise dawdling
love-songs, twangle the guitar, and strut about by the light
of the moon.  The Señorita de la Mendoza may again
dance El Son, to bring you to her side.  No longer
will I keep you from her, with the vain hope that, in
the capitals of the nations, you and I, uniting our
mentalities and working hand in hand, might have no small
part in the history-making of our generation.  Good-by,
Alfredo."  She extended her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-by, Silvia."
</p>

<p>
He opened the door and hesitated at the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, once more, is it final?"
</p>

<p>
The color faded from her face.  Her features set in
emotionless expression.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Alfredo&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p class="thought">

<br />
</p>

<p>
Over the sea strong wind flowed.  Bank after bank
of fog, rocked under powerful propulsion, was lifted
into the air, and disappeared.  Finally, from Point
Pinos to Santa Cruz the waters laughed and sparkled
in the late-coming sun.  Eleven men-of-war were
disclosed in the outer harbor, their wilderness of spars
clustering beneath the Union Jack.
</p>

<p>
Within the inner harbor two smaller vessels were at
anchor, the springs in their cables allowing them to
swing end to end in the shifting tides.  On their decks
grim-visaged men stood at the guns.  Their masts were
tipped with the Stars and Stripes.
</p>

<p>
The frigate United States and the sloop-of-war
Cyane had warped off the bar of Half Moon Bay.
Under cover of night, and undeterred by danger, they
had slipped past the English fleet which was nodding
lazily in the smooth sea, awaiting the coming of dawn
and the clearing of the fog.  Into the harbor, up to
the very eyes of the castle, they came.
</p>

<p>
With the sun's unveiling American marines rushed
into boats, hurried ashore and took possession of the
city.  The Red, White and Blue snapped saucily over
plaza and fort.
</p>

<p>
Signals fluttered on Admiral Fairbanks's flagship,
whipping the air in persistent command.  In reluctant
obedience the warships, for the second time, wheeled
slowly back to the ocean, the Vanguard in the rear, like
a stern parent driving his half-rebellious brood before
him.
</p>

<p>
In the upper room of the castle Silvia Valentino was
cognizant of none of these things.  In the moment of
Captain Morando's departure she had thrown herself,
face downward, on the floor, and lay weeping out her
heart.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />
A DAUGHTER OF THE DE LA MENDOZA
</h3>

<p>
"Pepita, Pepita, be thou watchful of those
threads.  Red follows yellow in the pattern, else
your weaving is hit-or-miss.  Santa Maria!  What
careless fingers!  See, the blanket is streaked in color,
like a pinto horse.  Thy knuckles, careless one, should
be made to ache, by rapping them smartly."
</p>

<p>
"Thou wilt rap no knuckles of mine, Marta.  Padre
Osuna forbids the matrona to strike any neophyte girl,
as thou well knowest.  It's hard enough to sit at a loom
day after day and weave blankets, when one isn't
mending them, or making baskets, or grinding maize,
without being beaten, if the fingers play tricks when the
thought happens elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
Marta was a matrona of the department of neophytes
in the single women's quarter of the Mission San José.
Her specialty was weaving blankets.  The Mission sheep
provided wool in plenty, and hand-made looms prepared
it for use, after it had been dyed the many
colors dear to the Indian taste.
</p>

<p>
"Fingers play tricks when the mind is elsewhere!
Well-a-day!  Why has one a mind but to direct the
fingers and the feet?  If Pedro Carrasca's mind ever
rests on thee, when it should be on cattle-driving,
behold! his pony will throw him over its head into the
dry oats."
</p>

<p>
A general laugh followed from the Indian women and
girls.
</p>

<p>
It was the Mission's busy season.  The harvest had
been abundant.  Though late in coming the rains had
been plentiful, and at proper intervals, so that the
yield in wheat, barley, oats, and corn was scarcely
below a good average.  Padre Osuna had sent a vessel
laden with cereals to Lower California, where bread
grains were scanty and good-priced.  A schooner
chartered at Yerba Buena had many thousand bushels of
seed-wheat on board, ready to sail to the settlements in
Oregon, when a reliable supercargo was found who
knew enough English to deal with the Americanos in the
North.
</p>

<p>
The great matanza of the year had just been held.
A half dozen trading ships were in San Francisco Bay,
buying the Mission hides and tallow.  Sovereignties
might change, flags come and go, but trade went on
forever.
</p>

<p>
The Mission's needs for the year were supplied from
the "Boston" ships, in return for the commodities of the
Mission.  In New England a demand had sprung up
for the varicolored blankets made from California wool
by the Indians.  Nowhere were blankets more skillfully
or more durably made than at Mission San José.
Accordingly, a large order had come from an Eastern
supply house; and the Mission Indian women and girls
worked longer hours than usual at the wooden frames.
These had been set up out of doors near the lodgment
of the unmarried women.
</p>

<p>
Pepita's eyes sparkled as the others laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Pedro Carrasca is no concern of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Well, maybe not," returned Marta, her black eyes
twinkling in her lean face.  "When the padre inspects
the blanket under your hand, if he sees poor work he will
scarcely sanction your betrothal to Pedro, one of the
best lads in the valley, as well as a vaquero of vaqueros;
and Pepita," patronizingly, "you can do good work
when you try."
</p>

<p>
"There are other vaqueros besides Pedro Carrasca."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, Pepita.  Felix Ubaldo is a better
rider than Pedro.  Pedro's shoulders are not always
straight in the saddle," said Florida Pardo.
</p>

<p>
"No such thing," defended Pepita.  "When the
broncho bucks, Felix goes up and down like the
jumping-jacks the little boys get for Christmas."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, children, work, work.  Talk less," from
the matrona.
</p>

<p>
Pepita stamped her foot.  "Work, work all the time.
Why was I not born a señorita, with people to serve
me, instead of having to work every day like an ox
drawing a carreta full of stones?"
</p>

<p>
"Saints in heaven!" from Marta.  "A crow isn't born
a songster, because crows have a use as well as singing
birds.  Pepita, thou art a blackamoor; still, thou may
become a peona of the Señorita Mendoza.  Modesta,
her serving maid, marries soon Tomaso, peon captain."
</p>

<p>
"O, Marta, is the Señorita Carmelita thinking of
making me one of her peonas?  How I would like
that!  Will you not ask the padre to recommend me to
the Señor Mendoza for his household?"  The girl got
up and put her arm wheedlingly about the woman.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell thee, Pepita, Modesta's my niece, and I
know of what I speak when I give you word of
happenings at the great hacienda house."
</p>

<p>
The matrona folded her arms.  The clicking of the
looms was stilled.  Indian maid and wife were as ready
to hear the gossip as was Marta to tell it.
</p>

<p>
"Last Saint John's day the quality of Santa Clara
valley attended high mass here.  As you remember, Lady
Carmelita played the organ.  Padre Osuna alone
excels her.  The Indian choir sang, and&mdash;Pepita, thou
sang well enough.  I will say, Señorita Mendoza was
much taken with thy solo part.  But do not overpride
thyself.  Thy voice, like thy good looks, is but a gift
to thee, not of thine own making."
</p>

<p>
"Tell us the story," the girl urged.
</p>

<p>
"Well, many white people had midday meal at Señor
Mendoza's.  Padre Osuna did not go, though he was
invited.  You see, our padre and the señor speak when
they meet, and seem friendly, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O, Marta, I don't want to hear about that.  Tell
what was said about me at the meal."
</p>

<p>
"Don't want to hear&mdash;don't want to hear," repeated
the matrona.  "Well, I shall say nothing at all, if I'm
not to speak my own way."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Marta," cried several, nearly as eager as
Pepita.
</p>

<p>
The matrona enjoyed their impatience for a while,
affecting to be very busy over her loom.  At last&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"At that midday meal Señorita Carmelita said she
had heard you, Pepita, sing, and liked your voice
as well as Modesta's; that she would soon need a new
lady's maid and liked your appearance.  Then, Señorita
Galindo said she once had you for lady's maid, but
sent you back to the neophyte house, because you
listened at keyholes and talked too much."
</p>

<p>
"I did not.  I did not," asserted Pepita.
</p>

<p>
"What did you do, then?" queried Marta.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't do anything."
</p>

<p>
"But thy tongue, vixen, is often loose, as if hung in
the middle, to wag at both ends.  Come now, what didst
thou say when thou talkedst too much?"
</p>

<p>
"I knew Señorita Galindo was in love with Don
Abelardo Peralta, and that he was not with her.  When
she pinched my arm for pulling her hair as I combed it,
I told her that Señor Peralta was in love with a lady in
Monterey, Señora Valentino."
</p>

<p>
"What did the Señorita Galindo say to that?"
</p>

<p>
"She pinched my arm more, and boxed my ears till I
cried; then sent me to Padre Osuna all covered with
lies."  Pepita spat at the remembrance.
</p>

<p>
The women turned to their looms again.  Marta
walked around examining their work, admonishing,
encouraging or assisting.
</p>

<p>
"Draw the threads tighter, Joséfa.  Pull them
equally, not one looser than the others.  Calvia, use
sense; your weave is uneven."
</p>

<p>
Passing her own loom she said: "This is a design
after which many blankets were made for Constancia
Alvarado, she who married Señor Mendoza.  The
señor's hair, then, was as black as any of yours.  Don
Marcel Hernandez has ordered six of each of these
patterns.  I shouldn't wonder if it means his daughter
is going to marry.  My man went to Spain once with
Señor Hernandez, to bring back horses.
</p>

<p>
"Tula, hasten, thy loom moves slowly, as if tired.
Wait till noon before resting.  Very good, Encarnacion;
the best you've done.  And thou, too, Jesusa."
</p>

<p>
As the matrona came to Pepita's side she said in low
voice: "Girl, worry thou not.  Soon another takes thy
loom and thou goest to service with the Lady Carmelita,
without doubt.  The padre will make recommend of
thee; but remember his words in last Sunday's sermon:
'Have a care as to what thou seest, what thou hearest,
and what thou sayest.'"
</p>

<p>
"I am not the only one that talks too much."
</p>

<p>
Marta recalled something to be done inside the house
and went away, telling the weavers to be industrious
during her absence.
</p>

<p>
When she was out of sight Encarnacion strolled over
to the end loom.  "Marta has pride that Padre Majin
de Catala, of Mission Santa Clara, baptized her mother.
Padre Junipero Serra himself baptized my grandfather,
in San Diego Mission.  Padre Junipero always said
that Indians who work hard and pray the Virgin every
day would be high in heaven when they died.  I never
heard he said that of lady's maids," looking at Pepita.
</p>

<p>
Pepita was happy in anticipation, and so made no
reply.
</p>

<p>
"Last year, when I was at Yerba Buena, in the family
of Señor Arguello," said Jesusa, whose loom had
become silent the moment of Marta's departure, "a very
old man at Mission Dolores said the sea did not always
run in and out there, past Yerba Buena, but mountains
once were where ships sail now.  I asked him if white
men had dug the way for the ocean, and he said white
men never work."  Jesusa was proud of her temporary
residence in Yerba Buena, and brought it forward at
every opportunity.
</p>

<p>
"Will the white men, then, who are not padres, go to
heaven?" inquired Tula, who had abandoned her work.
</p>

<p>
The theology of none of them was equal to a reply
for this question.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you suppose all the peon soldiers have
gone?  I saw many, many marching away this morning,
Señor Mendoza leading them.  San José de Guadalupe!
but they looked handsome!" said Elasia, a girl who had
seated herself on the ground, her hands lying idly in
her lap.
</p>

<p>
"Oho! the peon Ildefranco alone didst thou see.  We
know," said some one.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," joined in others.
</p>

<p>
"You have no need to talk.  You were all watching
them, and with your mouths wide open.  I saw you,"
retorted Elasia.
</p>

<p>
Everyone began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Comes Marta!  Comes Marta!" cried Encarnacion
from her point of vantage.
</p>

<p>
There was a general scurrying to place.  When the
matrona came out the silence was too intense to be
sincere.  She went from loom to loom.
</p>

<p>
"Your work is short by many inches of what it should
be.  If your chili con carne and meal were to be as short
to-day you would go hungry, and deserve it too.  I have
a mind to tell the padre how shiftless you all are, and
that unless I stand over you, not one of you will work."
</p>

<p>
"She's willing enough for us to stop work if she has
some tale to tell us about what Modesto heard; but if
we stop a minute to breathe, at any other time, it's
different," whispered one to her nearest companion, when
Marta's face was in another direction.
</p>

<p>
The noon Angelus commenced ringing.
</p>

<p>
The looms were at once deserted.
</p>

<p>
In the neophyte house lived over two hundred Indian
girls who were taught to read Spanish, together with
such housecraft as a peona should know, while the music
of the church occupied no small part in the daily
curriculum.  In addition, the neophytes were instructed in
weaving, in embroidery, drawn work, lace-making; and
from among them came the seamstresses who made
elaborate gowns for the ladies of the Spanish gentry.
</p>

<p>
Talking was not allowed during meals.  A book,
generally the life of some saint, was read aloud by a
matrona, or by some girl who was capable.  To-day the
book had been finished early.  There was not time to
begin another, so the rule of silence was dispensed with
during the remainder of dinner.  The girls proceeded
to enjoy the unwonted privilege, their zest for eating,
however, in no wise diminished.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, pandemonium burst over the place.  Indian
warwhoops were mingled with the crash of musket-firing.
Yelling and shouting were punctuated with pistol
shots.  The tawny mastiffs, night guardians of the
patio, now confined in a rear yard, howled a vicious
protest against this noonday interruption of their sleep.
</p>

<p>
Indian horsemen hurled themselves down the hills.
Indian forms arose from the ground where they had
hidden in shelter of vineyard and olive grove, and
avalanched on the Mission.
</p>

<p>
Mounted renegades whirled around the buildings,
cutting off avenues of escape for those within.  Men
on foot forced the porter's lodge in front, while others
rushed through the artisans' shops in the rear.
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna, Juan Antonio, major-domo, and nearly
every able-bodied peon of the Mission were busy with
the trading ships lying at the Embarcadero two leagues
away, on the south arm of San Francisco Bay.  The
institution was defenseless before the invaders, who were
under the capable command of a stocky, strongly built
aborigine who sat on his horse in the road which ran
alongside of the house of the girl neophytes.
</p>

<p>
"Bring up the led horses," the chief had ordered when
the uproar was greatest.
</p>

<p>
The screaming of frightened women broke out in
shrill notes, accompanied by the furious baying of the
mastiffs straining at their chains.
</p>

<p>
A shot or two sounded in the patio.
</p>

<p>
"Some of the women have got behind the gratings and
are shooting at their wooers," half laughed, half
grunted the leader.
</p>

<p>
"Stanislaus," asked a man near him, "can our fellows
get into this place where the girls are?  At Monterey
they are behind doors you couldn't smash with an ax
in half a day."
</p>

<p>
"Cayetano," was the reply, "I was major-domo here
for years.  The task set for those of us sent inside is
easy.  The peonas are spunky," he continued, "but
they'll be the better wives in the wild hills we go to.  If
the enemy comes, our tepees will not be undefended in
our absence."
</p>

<p>
Indians carrying struggling neophyte peonas filled
the porch of the house.  They sprang to the ground
below and upon the backs of the waiting mounts.  Soon
two hundred horses were bearing double burdens.
</p>

<p>
"Any more to come?" called Stanislaus.
</p>

<p>
"No," from a lieutenant who had been in charge of
the inside squad.
</p>

<p>
"Our way of finding wives may not please the
padre, but it's the only resource left us," said the
chief.
</p>

<p>
"It's a quicker method than the padre's," returned
the lieutenant, "and we're sure of our own pick."
</p>

<p>
"Now to the hills!" commanded the leader, adding:
"When Padre Osuna trails us home he can perform a
hundred double weddings at once."
</p>

<p>
The raiders spurred away eastward.  Some of the
girls, inert from fear, made no movement in their
captors' arms, others continued screaming and struggling.
Shortly their cries died away in the distance, and the
desolated Mission was left to the wailing matronas and
the old peons whose resistance had been too feeble to
attract notice from the marauders.
</p>

<p>
As unexpectedly as had the tumult begun across the
way, a clanging sounded from the topmost tower of
Mendoza's hacienda house.  It was an iron bar striking
with lightning rapidity the rim of a bell suspended in
the tower.  Three strokes a second it supplied, under
nicely arranged mechanism of block and pulley.
</p>

<p>
The clamor aroused every peon on the Mendoza
grant, for that call meant each task must be left without
delay, and all speed made to the hacienda house, as if
in matter of death and life.
</p>

<p>
Peons rushed from the Arroyo Seco, leagues to the
north, leaving their herds without caretakers.
Plowmen in the soft vegetable fields at the mouth of the
Arroyo Alameda flung the traces upon the horses'
backs, and galloped the heavy work animals toward
Mission San José.
</p>

<p>
Sturgeon-catchers in the far-away Alviso marshes
withheld the spear as their boat floated above the rotund
quarry.  "Ding, dong, ding," the hills were faintly
echoing.  The fishermen knew their duty, and straightway
discarding implement and fish, they pushed their
mustangs helter-skelter through slough and marsh to
their master's home ten miles distant.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita Mendoza stood in her father's bell tower,
her hand firmly pressing a lever.  This lever controlled
the heavy tongue striking the call to rescue.  The girl
had witnessed from her window the attack on the Mission;
had seen the renegades ride away with the stolen
neophyte girls.
</p>

<p>
Stanislaus had considered the time well, knowing that
Mendoza and his men were absent, as also Padre Osuna.
After the fall of Yoscolo and the severe defeat of his
men, the rancheros had thought the wild Indians too
thoroughly cowed to attempt further depredations;
thus all had relaxed vigilance, especially in the daytime.
</p>

<p>
The chief felt so secure that he sat on his horse
openly in the street during the raid.  The doña could
hear him jesting about the Indian girls, and caught the
words of his lieutenant.  She was an excellent marksman.
Her rifle, a recent importation from London, was
in a rack near at hand.  She sighted the weapon at the
chief, saw his face aligned with the barrel, and knew
that a pressure on the trigger would send a bullet
through his body.  Her hand refused to perform the
office.  She dropped the rifle to the hollow of her arm.
Faint for the moment, she leaned against the window
casing.
</p>

<p>
The outlaws streaming over the porch of the neophyte
house to the ground, together with the cries of the
peonas, aroused her.  Again she trained the rifle on
Stanislaus.  Though not more than a hundred feet away
he was too intent on the work at hand to scent possibility
of peril.  Carmelita's fingers drew on the trigger.
The slightest pressure further and the chieftain would
fall to an unhallowed death before the gate of the
Mission which once had honored him.
</p>

<p>
She threw the gun from her in horror.  Stanislaus
himself did not hesitate at the shedding of blood; and
was even now ready to inflict death if necessary to the
success of his plans, yet she could not bring herself to
be his executioner.
</p>

<p>
The girl flew to the bell-tower.  As the summons rang
she saw the retreating miscreants stretching over the
brow of the hill directly back of Mission San José.
The men with the girls were ahead in compact body, the
other Indians spread out to check pursuit if any should
be attempted.
</p>

<p>
In the Mendoza house the disorder was second only
to that prevailing at the Mission.  Women were crying,
praying, and calling aloud for the Señor Mendoza,
while the few men servants on the grounds ran hither
and thither, catching up weapons, throwing them down,
only to pick them up again and continue in their
purposeless meanderings.
</p>

<p>
The peons of the rancho began arriving.  By twos,
threes, tens and scores they came.  Bows, scythes and
clubs were the arms of war they brought.  Their
excited wives and children, straggling in after them,
increased the tumult.
</p>

<p>
The watch dogs of the Mission barked with renewed
vigor.  The Mission Indians, thinking the hacienda
house was being plundered also, wailed yet louder in
their fright.  Some of the peonas swayed hysterically
into the street and up to the front of the hacienda gate,
followed by the elderly peons who swung in circles
chanting wordless rhythms.  Frightened horses tore
unnoticed through the yard, snorting in terror.
</p>

<p>
At last the bell was silent.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita came to the courtyard gate.  The uncanny
movements of the frantic men and women were dizzying,
but she steadied herself.
</p>

<p>
"Hear me," she called.  "Listen!"
</p>

<p>
She waited a moment, then began: "Amigos, Stanislaus
and his men have come in from their fastnesses,
and have taken away from the Mission many girls.
These girls are daughters of our friends, and we desire
to see them married to men of this valley, the honest
men who tend herds and till the soil, and who will
provide food in plenty for their families.  The chief
will take the peonas off to the mountains of San Jacinto
or San Bernardino, as I overheard.  Friends mine, men
of this, our beloved valley, you must skim over the
mountains like hawks, overtake these ravishers, and
bring back the girls to their peaceful home in the
neophyte house, that our valley and Mission sleep Hot
desolate to-night."
</p>

<p>
There was no response.  The strong hearts had
followed Mendoza away at sunrise.  There remained
but the hewers of wood and the drawers of
water.
</p>

<p>
Finally one said: "These stolen muchachas are no
relatives of ours.  Forgive me, Lady Carmelita, if I
say, it is the business of their fathers and brothers to
undertake rescue."
</p>

<p>
The farm hand who thus spoke knew of Stanislaus
as a human bloodhound, as well as a tried and dauntless
warrior.  He would as lief interfere with the lion and
his bride as attempt to balk the chief.
</p>

<p>
"Will you see your peon brethren of the Mission sleep
in tears this night?  Do not the padres teach us that
the sorrow of one must be the grief of all?"
</p>

<p>
No one answered.  Motionless as well as voiceless were
the men and women.
</p>

<p>
"An hour's delay, and the renegades may be beyond
reach," she went on.
</p>

<p>
Still no response.
</p>

<p>
A cry sounded from the Mission patio, quivering with
anguish.  It came from some man's throat.
</p>

<p>
"Amigos," again from the girl, "listen to what you
hear.  Some father is stricken down in body by the
renegades, but his soul is calling aloud in bitterness for
his child.  Who will rush after the renegades and hang
to their flank, as the wolf stays the flight of the elk?
Who will go, I ask?"
</p>

<p>
The Indians shifted from foot to foot.  Some of the
peonas looked inquiringly at their husbands.  No one
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> will go," suddenly from Carmelita, her form
straightening, her face paling.  "Who will go with me?"
she challenged.  "I am only a woman, yet will I handle a
rifle in such a cause as this.  Who will go with me?"
</p>

<p>
A grizzled Indian stepped haltingly up to the girl.  "I
am only old Enrico," he said.  "I used to be one of the
fighting men of the señor, your father, but a bullet from
Yoscolo's band smashed my hip years ago and left me
fit only to hoe potatoes.  Señorita doña, I will go with
you and harry Stanislaus with what strength I have.  I
can never die in a better cause."
</p>

<p>
The señorita waited.  There were no other volunteers.
</p>

<p>
Enrico, turning, faced his fellows.  "I'll not say,
men," he exclaimed, "but whatever ye be, go to service
in the house, and let the maids there ride with the
señorita doña and me to the chastising of Stanislaus.
Go, for we are wasting time while the hostiles' pace
marks leagues the hour.  Go!  Cook the feed, wash the
dishes, make the beds, while the peonas do the fighting.
Ye cowards!  Go into the house where ye belong."
</p>

<p>
Enrico's sarcasm brought no result.  He turned back
to Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked past the old peon's upturned
face, over the heads of the unresponsive Indians,
out into the distance, her eyes resting on the eastern
hills.
</p>

<p>
"I hear no other offer.  So be it.  A woman and a
crippled old man ride forth alone.  It shall not be said
that the deed of to-day passes unopposed."  Her face
hardened, bright spots showing in either cheek.  Her
mouth set in lines which bespoke the fixity of her purpose.
</p>

<p>
Enrico raised his hands with affection and reverence.
"Señorita doña, these arms carried thee before thy
tongue could lisp a word.  I will go without thee.  Thou
must not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! hush! old friend.  Zunello," to a stable boy,
"two horses ready for the mounting, and two rifles.
Be quick!  Bring them here."
</p>

<p>
As said, so done.
</p>

<p>
"Come Enrico, I'll lend thee a shoulder to help thee
to the saddleseat."
</p>

<p>
In a moment she too was on her horse.  She checked
its head high and reined it mountainward.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, señorita, wait!  Here, doña, here!  I will go.
And I!  So will I!  So will I!  I!  I!  I!" swelled in hoarse
tones from the multitude.
</p>

<p>
"Take them at their word at once," whispered Enrico.
</p>

<p>
She needed no second prompting.  Couriers were sent
posthaste to San José pueblo, Yerba Buena and
Monterey, with messages acquainting the different
comandantes of the raid.
</p>

<p>
The Mendoza armory was opened and muskets,
powder and ball apportioned to the volunteers.
</p>

<p>
While horses were being brought the señorita, with
her corps of peona nurses, hastened to the Mission
grounds.  They found several peons who had been
severely manhandled lying insensible in the patio, or
trying to crawl to their quarters.  A half dozen or more
matronas had been beaten with clubs while offering
resistance to the summary taking-away of their charges.
</p>

<p>
The injured were given first-aid treatment, and the
terrified matronas encouraged to regain self-possession.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita soon left the Mission, to lead a
half-unwilling band of armed mounted men up the steep
grades to the east, to follow on the heels of Stanislaus,
to wrest from him, if they could, the prizes his daring
had gained for himself and his renegade followers.
</p>

<p>
The broad trail of the robbers led up the mountain,
skirted the Great Slide and into the pass toward the
valley of Calaveras where the merienda had been in
late spring.  Stanislaus, little apprehensive of
immediate pursuit, had allowed his fighting men to crowd into
the defile and mix with those carrying the neophyte
girls, leaving the rear of his march unguarded.  Discipline
thus relaxed the riflemen passed the time bandying
words with the others.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Bartolo," from a fighting man, "the damsel
with thee would better be in the saddle, and thou in her
arms.  Santa Cruz! if she snatches another handful of
thy mop thou wilt be as bald as a buckeye."
</p>

<p>
The "damsel" was none other than Pepita, who
vigorously pulled her captor's hair and beat his face
whenever opportunity offered.
</p>

<p>
"She's pretty as a yearling fawn," parried Bartolo.
"Art sweet-tempered and playful, little one?  No?"
</p>

<p>
The "little one" replied by so energetically pushing
her foot into the pit of Bartolo's stomach that he was
nearly overbalanced.
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha!" jeered the first speaker, "pass her to me,
Bartolo.  Otherwise it's plain who'll pound the corn
and bake the tortillas in thy wickiup."
</p>

<p>
"A devil bite thee, Naciso," growled Bartolo.  "Quit,
thou angel," to Pepita, "or thou wilt find that in a
matter of blows I can give as well as take."
</p>

<p>
At the eastern end of the pass the sides became sheer
declivities; while the roadway, a sharp incline, so
narrowed that a part of Stanislaus's riflemen were forced
to lead the procession, the remainder to go to the rear,
as a wet sponge squeezed in the middle drips at both
ends.
</p>

<p>
"Halt!" like a thunder-bolt in clear sky, came a
stentorian shout from the western outlet.  It was
Enrico, and ranged by his side and Carmelita Mendoza's
were three hundred men whose carbines were gleaming
in the afternoon sun.
</p>

<p>
Less than four hours elapsed since noon, and Stanislaus
had calculated that no rescuing party could be
organized before the following day.  He was astounded.
Morando, he knew, had gone to Monterey with Señor
Mendoza.  His scouts had brought the word shortly
before the attack at the Mission.
</p>

<p>
The pursuers quickly thinned their line and stretched
across the mouth of the pass.
</p>

<p>
The chief, ever quick-witted, formulated a plan on
the moment&mdash;to gain time by parleying, meanwhile
surreptitiously to recall his riflemen to the front, thus,
with his fighters together, hold the ground till night
when he would escape under cover of dark.  So:
</p>

<p>
"Under whose leadership come you?" he questioned.
"Captain Morando's?"
</p>

<p>
There was no reply.  He repeated:
</p>

<p>
"Who's your leader, I say?  Captain Morando?" his
eyes searching the ranks of the newcomers.
</p>

<p>
Silently men began filtering through the press back
to Stanislaus's side, in accordance with his low-toned,
hurriedly given order.
</p>

<p>
"Has that one word from you left your tongue
benumbed, fool?  Who heads you?" inwardly swearing at
his stupidity in allowing his fighting force to become
divided.  "Answer me.  Who heads you?"
</p>

<p>
"The Señorita Doña Carmelita Mendoza," replied
Enrico, impressively.
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast ever been a joker, old man," guffawed
Stanislaus.  "Call to mind Salinas field where our bullet
overtook thee, and bawl a joke about that."
</p>

<p>
Carmelita advanced her horse a few steps.  "Stanislaus,
I remember you as Padre Duran's major-domo,
at Mission San José.  Come forth here and meet me,
and let you and me alone arrange for returning the
peonas to their home.  For each rifle of yours we have
two to oppose, and reenforcements are hurrying to join
us.  Come, let us speak together."
</p>

<p>
Her words to the renegade rang through the narrow
cañon with the weight of a command.  Amazement held
the outlaw's tongue.  To be summoned to war
conference with a señorita was an experience hitherto
unknown.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, Stanislaus," her turn, now, to insist, "or have
you become dumb?  Or, are you afraid to ride out to
meet a woman?"
</p>

<p>
"I must have time to consult my lieutenants,"
dissimulated the chief.  "Stand at one side, then, with your
lieutenants.  Let no other among you move."
</p>

<p>
The vigor of her spirit, showing through manner and
speech, caused the interfiling among Stanislaus's men
to lessen, then to cease.
</p>

<p>
"Is Señor Mendoza there?" he inquired.  Then, in
undertone, through shut teeth.  "Carajo! slip along
here, you scared rabbits, or I'll burn every one of you
alive!"
</p>

<p>
Again the straggling rifles began pushing back to him.
</p>

<p>
"The Señor Mendoza is not here, but his daughter is.
Take no further steps, not one of you, or I will order
my men to fire."
</p>

<p>
Circling her horse, she gave the word: "See to your
priming!  Present your pieces!" as she had seen her
father do on many an occasion.
</p>

<p>
"Hold, señorita!" from Stanislaus.  "'Tis very fitting
that we confer, but I must have my lieutenants'
agreement."  Then, in somewhat lower key: "Such fat wits
you lieutenants are.  I can beat nothing into you except
with my pistol butt.  Draw nearer, you rattle-pated
grass-eaters."
</p>

<p>
This reached Carmelita's ears, as he intended it
should; but she did not fail to catch in it the temporizing
to bring to his side those of his riflemen who had
not already wormed their way back.
</p>

<p>
"Girl stealer, deliver the peonas with you to us,
else you and your fellow thieves will lie here, food for
vulture and coyote," challenged the señorita, true
daughter of the soldier de la Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Have care, doña," cautioned Enrico.  "The
miscreant's talk means treachery."
</p>

<p>
"Stanislaus is going to shoot!" screamed Pepita in
warning.  "He&mdash;&mdash;"  The last word ended in a gurgle,
a hand closing around her throat.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the outlaws fired from the hip, with accurate
aim.  The bullets cut through the air.  Many of
Carmelita's Indians had wheeled under their horses at
Pepita's cry of warning, thus saving themselves.
However, not a few of the shots, flying low, found home in
flesh and bone of both man and beast.  The hoarse cry
of stricken horses drowned the moan of fallen men.
Confusion reigned among the raw recruits from the
Mendoza hacienda, for the first time facing veterans.
Wounded horses threshing from side to side, or struggling
backward or forward, added disorder to disorder.
</p>

<p>
A fierce exhilaration possessed the señorita as the
leaden whispers of death parted before her face.  The
heritage of twenty generations asserted itself, bringing
with it the intoxication of battle and the genius of
generalship.  As there was no fear in her heart, so was
there, for the time being, no room for sorrow at the
suffering and death about her.  She knew only a
vehement desire to dash upon Stanislaus, beat him to the
dust, scatter destruction over his men, ride triumphantly
back to the foothills, and return the peonas to
the arms of their matronas.
</p>

<p>
The confusion among the hacienda workmen became
a panic.  "Escape!" one yelled, and spurred his horse to
safety.  One after another burst from the ranks, to
follow like frightened sheep.  Volley after volley whistled
after them from the outlaws' pistols and carbines.
Derisive yells and laughter came from the seasoned fighters.
</p>

<p>
A figure darted past the fleeing peons.  A horse was
brought up across the road in front of them, and
Carmelita faced the retreating mob.
</p>

<p>
"Back to the cañon's mouth!" she commanded.  "I'll
shoot the man who yields another step," pointing
significantly to her rifle.  Her eyes blazed with terrible
insistence, her face chalk-white with passion.
</p>

<p>
The terrified peons paused.  To their superstitious
natures their young mistress was become a threatening
god from another world.
</p>

<p>
"The cañon's mouth is the mouth of hell," some one
found courage to say.
</p>

<p>
"It is the gate of deliverance for the girls those
renegades have stolen.  Back to the pass, hombres!
Back to the pass! and fight till the death!"  She waved
her rifle over her head.  "Back to the pass, hombres,
and make rescue!"
</p>

<p>
She turned her horse toward the cañon.  "Follow me!"
</p>

<p>
She went forward.  The men obeyed.  From a walk,
they urged their horses into a gallop, then into topmost
speed.  The dispirited rabble became a fighting
battalion.
</p>

<p>
Stanislaus, in curiosity to see what had become of the
column so rashly attacking him, had moved back into
the wake of the retreating peons.
</p>

<p>
The hoof-thunder of horses tempestuously advancing
caused him to throw his force into a hollow square,
fearing that some body of capable soldiery, having tracked
him, was about to make a charge on him.
</p>

<p>
For the third time within half an hour the chief's
senses were held in wonder.  The approaching troop
was the same which a few minutes before had ignominiously
fled before him.  Rapidly they deployed, under
Carmelita's orders, the line thus formed making the men
a more difficult target, as the girl had learned in
watching her father train fighting peons.
</p>

<p>
"Present rifles!  Aim!  Fire!" the señorita called in
a single breath.
</p>

<p>
The cañon shook under the deafening detonation that
resulted.  Boulders, loosened by the concussion, rolled
down the sides of the defile.  A thousand echoes
reiterated the vengeance of the valley peons.
</p>

<p>
Stanislaus's Indians, massed together, withered
under the tremendous fusillade.  Only those in front
could use their weapons to advantage, the riflemen on
sides and rear of the square being in danger of hitting
their fellows, if they attempted to shoot low enough
to strike among their enemy.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita fired her rifle, reloaded it and fired it again
and again, till the weapon clogged with powder-smut
and became so heated that she could scarcely hold the
barrel for sighting.
</p>

<p>
The undrilled peons from the rancho, steadied by her
example, added coolness to their enthusiasm.  Despite
their friends falling everywhere around them, under
Stanislaus's desperate defense, their line gradually was
closing in on him, their carbines, flash upon flash,
cracking in deadly purpose.
</p>

<p>
The Indian chieftain's number was decimated seriously;
still, in hollow square formation, he slowly
backed to the narrow end of the pass, here to wait for
the protecting shadows of night.
</p>

<p>
Relays of peons, arriving at the Mendoza hacienda
late, hastened after Carmelita and the others.  These
reenforcements brought dismay to the hard-driven
savages fighting against time for their opportunity to
escape with their booty.
</p>

<p>
Stanislaus, knowing the value of active offense in such
an emergency, detached Cayetano and a body of
selected men, to make a sortie.
</p>

<p>
Cayetano's face seamed.  His teeth bared.  "Knock
the wenches on the head!  Then every man for himself! or,
we'll never leave this rat-trap alive."
</p>

<p>
"Cayetano, to the front, as I say!  Lead the attack!"
ordered the chief.
</p>

<p>
"Lead it yourself.  Your bones will look as well
whitening the ground as mine."
</p>

<p>
Stanislaus, without further word, struck to his death
the insubordinate.
</p>

<p>
The dire fate Cayetano had wished to visit on the
peonas was seconded by the menacing looks of not a
few of the abductors.  "Yes, knock the girls on the
head!  Knock the girls on the head!  Let's get out of
here!  Curse the witches anyway!" could be heard on
all sides.
</p>

<p>
"They are going to kill us! to kill us!" pierced the
air laden with smoke of battle and the odor of blood.
"O, save us!  Save us!  Have pity on us!  Take us
home!  Mother in Heaven!  O, save us!"
</p>

<p>
Goaded to frenzy by these cries, Carmelita's peons
flooded across the intervening space and fell on Stanislaus,
who abandoned to their fate the sortie detail he
had thrown forward.  With such men as he could muster
he sped, with the peonas, out of the cañon into the
broken country edging Calaveras Valley.  Here his
people seemed to scatter.  Hoof-tracks led aimlessly to
every quarter of the compass.
</p>

<p>
To solve the riddle the hacienda peons ran over the
ground and nosed it like hounds.  No one could tell in
which direction to go in succor of the peonas.
</p>

<p>
From his saddle old Enrico peered at the signs which
to the ordinary observer indicated that Stanislaus and
his people had come in compact body to this spot, then,
under centrifugal impulse, had departed hither and
yon.
</p>

<p>
In his observings the man moved a little away from
Carmelita, then returned.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita doña, I'm proud of the boys; they're all
right&mdash;that onslaught&mdash;line lasted them about as long
as a box of mice would a dozen terriers&mdash;but they can't
read a trail."
</p>

<p>
"Then, you be eyes for us, Enrico," pleaded
Carmelita.  "Soon the sun leaves, and search to-morrow will
be useless."
</p>

<p>
Enrico dismounted, slowly crawled on knees and
hands, examining the ground minutely.  He descended
into a swiftly running stream, and studied the rocky
bed through the clear water.  Finally, he crept up the
other side and limped away into the forest.
</p>

<p>
It seemed an age before he came back.  Long shadows,
forerunners of approaching night, were measuring the
hills beyond.  At last he was in sight, exultation
lighting his face and hastening his uncertain steps.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita doña," he exclaimed, "Stanislaus is near
here, on foot, and consequently at our mercy."
</p>

<p>
"How so, Enrico?" quickly from Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"His horses left that stream riderless, as their
plunging gait shows; though they went into it under
bridle, as is plain from the even measure of their step.
The foot impression of men's hard-leather soles lies in
that creek-bed.  Stanislaus and many with him wear
Mission shoes of tanned cattle-skin.  Furthermore,"
holding up a knot of ribbon, "this adornment was
caught on a low-sweeping madrona branch, and these,"
showing several wet deer-skin moccasins inlaid with
glass beads, "I plucked from crevices where the bottom
of the stream is rocky.  The scoundrelly renegades
cannot be far away.  Let us rush down on them, having
caution, though, for ambuscade."
</p>

<p>
"They are bound for the cave two miles farther down
the cañon, and they sought to deceive us into following
riderless horses.  We must cut them off before they
reach the shelter," cried Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
She led the way at break-neck speed through chaparral,
over gullies, up rocky heights that would have taxed
the climbing abilities of a goat, down a long,
thickly-shrubbed glade, to a ragged opening under a cliff.  It
was the exit through which, the night of the storm,
Farquharson and Brown, with Yoscolo and Stanislaus,
had passed from the cave which gave refuge to
Carmelita and her dueña.
</p>

<p>
"Within and quickly!" called the girl, driving
straight through the natural door.  The peons thronged
after her.
</p>

<p>
Light made its way into the many-chambered cavern
through the innumerable rifts in the rocky mountain
side.  Carmelita led the way to the lower entrance where
the carreta had come to grief.  Here they waited, grim
figures in the twilight silence.
</p>

<p>
"Some are coming," Enrico whispered after a moment.
</p>

<p>
They saw many forms approaching.  The Indians,
carrying the girls in their arms, stalked in single file,
each stepping with precision in the footprints of his
predecessor, to give the impression that but one man
had passed that way.  The semidarkness of the cave
prevented their seeing anyone inside.
</p>

<p>
"Drop your rifles!  Up with your hands!" Carmelita's
voice gathered volume from the great spaces behind.
</p>

<p>
Stanislaus and his men were petrified.
</p>

<p>
"Drop your rifles!  Up with your hands!" repeated
the girl.
</p>

<p>
"Stanislaus, show yourself to be a joker.  Make a
jest!" mocked old Enrico.
</p>

<p>
The renegades dropped the peonas; the most of them
threw away their weapons; all fled precipitately.  Thus
ended the memorable raid of Stanislaus, the Indian
renegade, unaccountably put to rout by a delicately
reared señorita.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita and the peons quickly gathered around
the neophytes.  Despite the severe experience of the day
not one of the girls had received injury.  Amid tears
and laughter they loudly expressed their gratitude to
their deliverers.  Their vociferations were silenced by
the sound of musketry discharge, in the direction
toward which Stanislaus and his men had gone.  Many
of the peons, mad with thirst of slaughter, tore
thitherward.
</p>

<p>
Soon musketry rattled again, this time much nearer
the cave.  The girl, leaving Enrico and a guard in
charge of the peonas, rode after the men.  She climbed
a steep hill.  Looking over a crag into the valley below,
she saw that which clutched her heart.
</p>

<p>
Captain Morando lay wounded there.  Stanislaus,
knife in hand, was leaping down a narrow path toward
him.  The soldier's pistol was lying several feet away.
He attempted to reach it, but ineffectually.
</p>

<p>
The Indian growled wolf-like as he neared his enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" shrieked Carmelita, springing from her horse
and madly bounding down the path.
</p>

<p>
"You villain!" she flung at Stanislaus, as she faced
him.
</p>

<p>
Except for the knife he was unarmed.  He saw that
her hands were empty.  She had left her rifle on the
saddle.  He jumped toward her.
</p>

<p>
"Up the path, for God's sake, Carmelita!" weakly
cried the stricken Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Never!  I'll die first!"
</p>

<p>
The knife was cleaving the air.  The girl saw only
Don Alfredo.
</p>

<p>
"Pause! renegade," a deep voice sounded back of them.
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna had vaulted from an overhanging shelf.
Catching Stanislaus's wrists he wrenched the knife
from his hand.  Raising the desperado from the earth
he hurled him with volcanic power against a tree-trunk.
The creature fell senseless.  Examination showed him
to be stunned only.
</p>

<p>
The friar took Morando's head in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Where the hurt, my brother?"
</p>

<p>
"My shoulder," his eyes closing in oblivion.
</p>

<p>
"O, Padre, is Alfredo much injured?" her low words
trembling with emotion.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot yet tell, doña," sympathetic concern for
the prostrate man showing in his face and voice as he
half whispered the reply.
</p>

<p>
"The wound is deep&mdash;and ugly&mdash;on the left side, too&mdash;I
don't like its looks."  He seemed to be speaking to
himself, as his taper fingers deftly and gently searched
the course of the bullet.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita scarcely breathed.
</p>

<p>
"Get some water from that spring, doña, quick.  His
pulse is stopping.  Bring it in his cap; there's nothing
else."
</p>

<p>
The girl's feet scarcely touched the ground in
performing the task.
</p>

<p>
The friar dashed the water in Morando's face.  His
pulse showed no quickening.  Carmelita hastened for
another supply of water.  This was as ineffective as the
first.  A third capful brought a slight return of animation.
</p>

<p>
"He's a little better now."
</p>

<p>
"O, padre."
</p>

<p>
Morando looked slowly up at them.
</p>

<p>
"Better now, brother?  Good," as Morando slightly
nodded.  "We'll have you around soon.  Lie very quietly
and rest."
</p>

<p>
At sight of the pallid face lying against the padre's
arm, Carmelita turned and walked away, to conceal the
sobbing that would not down.
</p>

<p>
"But the bullet has found no vital part.  Here it is,
lodged in the muscles under the arm," the friar soon
announced cheeringly.
</p>

<p>
Immediately Carmelita returned, her face speaking
joy, her lips silent.
</p>

<p>
"With good care our caballero will recover.  Thank
God!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" repeated the girl, her throat hardly
vocalizing the words.
</p>

<p>
"And now, señorita, mia, may we trouble thee for
more water?  Our pitcher lacks size, therefore must it
go often to the well."
</p>

<p>
Morando drank eagerly, with the thirst of the
wounded.  Refreshed, he tried to move to a sitting
posture.  The padre gently restrained him.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, my friend.  A little more rest."
</p>

<p>
Morando again closed his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I forgot to send you word to-day, padre," from the
señorita.
</p>

<p>
"Word came, nevertheless, doña.  My men cross-tracked
the renegades in the hills above us and are now
chasing them."
</p>

<p>
Stanislaus, regaining consciousness from a shock that
would have broken the bones of an ordinary man, made
an attempt for freedom.  The friar's hand whirled him
back.
</p>

<p>
"Estanislao, many unshriven souls have this day gone
before God because of you.  Have you no compunctions?"
</p>

<p>
The Indian glowered.
</p>

<p>
"Señorita, I will leave Captain Morando with you
a few minutes, while I find men and improvise a litter.
As for you, son of Belial," speaking to Stanislaus,
"walk before me until I can get safe custody for you."
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna drove the sulky renegade up the path.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita brought fresh water and bathed the
wounded man's face.  He lay very still.  At last he
opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Carmelita, what are you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that till later."
</p>

<p>
"I went part way to Monterey with Señor Mendoza,
then I returned to San José, where I received your
message," he said in weak voice.  "I could only bring a few
volunteers, my soldiers having continued on with the
señor."
</p>

<p>
"Please do not talk.  You are not strong enough.
The padre will soon bring assistance, and we will take
you to my father's house."
</p>

<p>
He lay quiet once more.  The girl thought he slept.
Her smooth hands continued bathing his face.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to offend you, Carmelita.  I didn't
know&mdash;of your engagement&mdash;to Don Abelardo."
</p>

<p>
"So you have heard that old story!  Why, Alfredo,
I have never been engaged to anyone."
</p>

<p>
His eyes opened wide.  A faint flush spread over his
pale cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Never engaged&mdash;never engaged&mdash;you are not going
to marry Peralta&mdash;not marry him?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she smiled.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br />
A DEPARTURE
</h3>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza, there is no use to continue
this parley.  It does no good.  I have possession
of California.  That possession I shall retain."
</p>

<p>
"The enlightened will of the people of this province
must decide whether you retain possession, or
relinquish it, Commodore Billings."
</p>

<p>
The two were standing within the fort, at a window.
They were alone.  The marines of the frigate United
States and the sloop-of-war Cyane were drilling not
far away.  The soft, "plush, plush, plush" of their
feet could be heard, following the staccato calls for
maneuvers.
</p>

<p>
"I relinquish possession only when forced to do so."
</p>

<p>
"The proposal was made and accepted that your
government hold Monterey tentatively."
</p>

<p>
"Never accepted by me.  Our consideration of that
question was broken up by Señor Zelaya sprinting
in with news that Fairbanks's ships were passing south.
The subject was not taken up again."
</p>

<p>
"But O'Donnell accepted it, Commodore.  He has
letters from Mr. Tyler, your President, countersigned
by your Secretary of State, giving him full power to
act for his government."
</p>

<p>
"Produce O'Donnell and his papers, Colonel Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
"O'Donnell started eastward at midnight, as you well
know.  Two months will scarce see his return."
</p>

<p>
"Señor Mendoza, I found the capital here without
government of any kind; in other words, deserted."
</p>

<p>
"The absence of the people's servants, whether in
fort or government house, does not make void that
people's rights."
</p>

<p>
"I led my ships through peril of fog and night, to
gain advantage of the British.  Had they reached here
before me, then, Señor Mendoza, this enlightened will
of which you speak might go to Jericho."
</p>

<p>
"The British would have arrived here before you, as
you are well aware, had not trading vessels, which I
have under charter, at gravest risk drawn you away
from certain wreck."
</p>

<p>
Billings raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Commodore, in plain words, you are engaged in a
piece of filibustering.  The United States is not back
of such a movement as this."
</p>

<p>
The Commodore paced away savagely, then turned.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Mendoza, possession is nine points of law,
and I have possession.  Demonstrate a better right
than mine; and maintain it, if you can!"
</p>

<p>
The Spaniard, stooping, raised a heavy trapdoor.
He threw it back.  Iron-barred windows lighted a
chamber beneath.  Mounds of powder were heaped around
everywhere.
</p>

<p>
"Commodore Billings, we are standing over the
powder-magazine of this fort."
</p>

<p>
"So I perceive, Señor Mendoza."
</p>

<p>
The señor looked coolly at the other.
</p>

<p>
"Well, perceive this."  From his pocket he drew a
taper, used for lighting cigaritos, ignited it and held
it up.
</p>

<p>
"Man, what are you about?  Put out that fire!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Stand near&mdash;not too close.  Now, look at that
black sand."
</p>

<p>
Billings's mouth shut hard.
</p>

<p>
"In that sand, Commodore, there is power enough
pent up to blow your marines to atoms, if I drop this
tiny piece of flame.  You and I&mdash;well, Commodore
Billings, it is not necessary to consider ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza held the taper between thumb and forefinger.
Two paces distant, across the aperture in the
floor, the Commodore stood, his hand resting on a pistol
which he did not draw.
</p>

<p>
"Shoot, Señor Billings," Mendoza said quietly, still
holding the taper over the powder.
</p>

<p>
Billings's hand dropped from the pistol to his side.
</p>

<p>
"Then, cry aloud for help, my señor."
</p>

<p>
"Mendoza, what are you about?" hoarsely asked the
Commodore.  "What do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"That you leave Monterey."
</p>

<p>
Billings's teeth ground together.  "Never!"
</p>

<p>
"Never?" glancing at the taper.
</p>

<p>
"It would not be the first house you have blown up."
</p>

<p>
"But it would be the last, my Commodore."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza seemed to grow in stature, to become
colossal, terrible.
</p>

<p>
"This taper burns low.  I have not another."
</p>

<p>
Billings's form relaxed.
</p>

<p>
"Your province is not worth a quarter thousand
lives."
</p>

<p>
"So, you decide, Señor Billings.  Well, open that
window, then, and order your men to the ships."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not.  What a diabolical advantage for you
to take, Mendoza!"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the sort.  I merely insist on the
preservation of the rights of this province.  You proclaim
your intention of violating these rights, notwithstanding
O'Donnell's pledged words."
</p>

<p>
The flame pointed its unsteady way higher.
</p>

<p>
"One minute more you have, Commodore Billings."  Slowly
Mendoza turned his hand.  The taper slipped
a little through his fingers.  "Now, Señor Billings,
or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Commodore's voice shouted to his marines.  His
lips were framing a call for help.
</p>

<p>
The taper moved downward a little farther.  "Commodore
Billings, you thus cast the die?  One&mdash;two&mdash;"
a significant pause.
</p>

<p>
The Commodore's hollow voice ordered his men to
the ships.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza extinguished the taper.  In one hand he
still held its end; in the other he meaningly grasped
the flint.  He did not speak.
</p>

<p>
Billings repeated his command, till every wondering
marine had embarked.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza's peon riflemen filed into the castle; white
gunners who had seen service in Manila, manned the
cannon.  The muzzle of the ordnance inclined until
their lips opened threateningly over the boats teetering
in the surf.  Three hundred sharpshooters, lent Mendoza
by Captain Sutter, of New Helvetia, thickened in
the auxiliary battery.
</p>

<p>
A salvo would be echoed by a thousand small arms.
</p>

<p>
Commodore Billings foresaw certain destruction in
resistance.
</p>

<p>
As he was stepping into the last-departing boat
Mendoza said to him:
</p>

<p>
"Because you came as conqueror we bid you go."
</p>

<p>
In an hour the harbor was empty, the flagpoles of
square and castle bare.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br />
ODDS AND ENDS
</h3>

<p>
Señora Valentino, rather pale, was sitting
in the room adjoining the treasure-chamber of the
old Spanish governor.  Captain Farquharson was
opposite.
</p>

<p>
"So you return to Europe to-morrow, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, señora, and glad am I to have the conveniences
of a home-going war vessel.  When do you go?"
</p>

<p>
"In a month or so&mdash;some time in the latter part of
October."
</p>

<p>
"I regret I was able to give your brilliant work here
such inefficient aid."
</p>

<p>
"My work here has been a brilliant failure," with a
little laugh that was half a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Señora, except for an altogether unforseeable
combination of adverse circumstances California to-day
would be English territory."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if the wind had not blown; if the fog had not
obscured, and if night had not come; or, to put it in
different words, if Fairbanks had not been Fairbanks."
</p>

<p>
"The magnanimity of these squadron commanders is
overpowering, Admiral Fairbanks having his equal in
Commodore Billings.  Why, the capital simply rolled
into Billings's hands.  Then, he and Mendoza are seen
in the castle holding some sort of a conference.  The
first thing we know, the castle is evacuated, and the
Administrator of Mission San José is left cock of the walk."
</p>

<p>
"That is history as it is written, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"O, nothing of any consequence.  I was merely thinking
aloud; that is all."
</p>

<p>
"My lady, I assure you I was standing at the old
parade ground, an interested spectator of the
exhibition of the manual of arms, when the occurrence of
which I have spoken took place."
</p>

<p>
"My peon friend, Alberto, crept up under a window,
within earshot of Commodore Billings and Señor Mendoza
as they were having that little conference of theirs.
What Alberto heard has cost him many a nightmare
since."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, I'm in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Captain, in any case, it is a closed book
to us now.  Administrator Mendoza has gained advantage
in the first throw.  We'll leave England's
cause in the hands of those whom the Home Office will
send out.  Who wins the game only the future will
disclose."
</p>

<p>
"Many will miss you here, my lady."
</p>

<p>
"Crisostimo and my sister go with me, at least, as
far as Spain.  Our ship will round the Cape of Good
Hope, not Cape Horn, as does yours.  My brother-in-law,
having sent in his resignation as official here to the
government in Mexico, has sold his holdings in California
to a company of which Señor Mendoza is president."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, I referred to the province at large.  You
have a cherished place in the hearts of many."
</p>

<p>
"It is a delight to be held in good estimation.  I
appreciate all the kind thoughts."
</p>

<p>
"As to the province in particular.  On my way here
I met Abelardo Peralta, in company with young Ysidro
de la Barra and the half-'Boston,' Sam Watson.  Don
Abelardo was saying he had laid the Rancho San Antonio
at your feet for the fifth time, and for the fifth
time had found himself closing your door from the
outside, a rejected suitor."
</p>

<p>
She smiled.  "Abelardo is a dear boy, but very, very
young."
</p>

<p>
"De la Barra and Watson each declared Morando
stands between them and their happiness.  They would
challenge the Captain to a duel, and, dying spit by his
rapier, they would leave their haciendas to you, in
touching remembrance of their devotion.  Peralta,
on the contrary, rather scoffed, and said he
would live, and see the soldier Captain leave your house
biting his fingers in disappointment, as he himself had
done."
</p>

<p>
The señora's pale face flushed.  The toe of her
slipper tapped the floor.
</p>

<p>
"I told them," the man not noticing, went on,
jocularly, "that I had known many suitors in Europe
leaving you disconsolate, but had never heard of any
deaths therefrom.  Whereupon they insisted that I
too am your suitor.  I told them I am too old and
battered for such a beautiful young lady, besides having a
cherished wife at home, a very good friend of the Señora
Valentino.  The two again denounced Morando, declaring
their certainty that the Captain would be the
victor."
</p>

<p>
"You are much interested in romance, I see, Captain.
Tell me that old story connected with your life in
Dublin.  You referred to it once, and aroused my interest.
We were too busy then, but now we have a little leisure
for diversion."
</p>

<p>
"Doubtless it would be to you a twice-told tale."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, anyway, Captain.  We all like to hear
good stories, and especially from the lips of the actor
himself."
</p>

<p>
"In the springtime of life sentiment bubbles up, and
over, with the most of us.  So was it with me.
</p>

<p>
"Soon after I received my commission as Captain our
regiment was ordered to Dublin.  A young recruit who
had taken the queen's shilling was assigned to the
grenadier company, my own.  A veritable giant of a
man he was, and had in him the making of a consummate
soldier.  Both of us saw light first on the bank of
the lordly Shannon, I, in the hall, he, in a cottage of
my father's estate.  His parents still live in the old
cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the giant soldier-boy and I became almost
chums.  I had just come from several gay seasons that
London gave us, and I felt pretty much at outs with
the inanity of my own class.  He was fresh and original,
and I had known him from childhood.  Of course he
loved a girl.  She was in domestic service, but as good
as gold.  I thought I was in love with her too.  But,
pshaw! she had more sense than I.  Otherwise, we
might have married, and have been miserable for life.
Still, she did seem a breath of heaven after the women
of my own set."
</p>

<p>
"You forgot Lady Matilda," prompted the señora,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"My wife is one of God's good women, and I pray we
shall be able to rear our little daughter to be like her.
What I am relating occurred many years before I met
Matilda."
</p>

<p>
"Good, my friend!  And now for the rest of the tale!"
</p>

<p>
"A breach opened, and widened, between O'Donnell
and me.  She preferred him, you see, wherein she was
wise.
</p>

<p>
"Then followed some words of mine for which I have
always been sorry.  I tried to make her believe he
wasn't worthy of her, and all that.  I didn't actually
succeed, though she allowed him to think I did.  I suppose
at the time she really did half believe what I had
insinuated.
</p>

<p>
"The young man stormed, pleaded, and raved.  She
seemed not to heed.  One afternoon, on the parade
ground, I rallied him harshly for some error in the drill
which was really most immaterial.  Then I sneered some
beastly words at him.  He clubbed his carbine and
attacked me.  I dodged and a glancing blow struck my
shoulder and head.  I was disabled for a year."
</p>

<p>
After a short wait, he went on:
</p>

<p>
"And I deserved what I received.  By some miracle
O'Donnell escaped capture.  For some years he was in
South America; then he came to California, went
among the plains Indians east of here, and became a
mighty sachem among them.  When he was in Washington,
on some delegation for the Indians, he came
under attention of high officials of the United States
Government.  No word need be said of his work here,
señora," with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"What of the peasant maid, Captain?  You are
forgetting her."
</p>

<p>
"She read of O'Donnell's activities, it seems; and
learned of my presence here through the same source,
the newspaper.  The man-of-war lately from England,
which brought news of my father's death, together with
my accession to his title and estates, carried a letter to
me from her, inclosing another to O'Donnell.  I
delivered his letter in person.  I told him I am glad his
old love is waiting for him, and promised when I get
home to have all disability removed, so he can return
and claim his bride.  O'Donnell and I parted on the
terms of our old-time friendship."
</p>

<p>
"Why did not the girl write direct to O'Donnell himself?"
</p>

<p>
"She was sure of my address, but not of his."
</p>

<p>
"I am more than glad that your story has such a
happy ending."
</p>

<p>
"I had come on O'Donnell in the city plaza.  We were
sitting together in conversation when Mendoza walked
up and greeted me with all possible cordiality, as a
former comrade-in-arms.  I found that the Administrator
remembered me perfectly, and has kept track of me
rather closely, the world over, considering distance and
isolation."
</p>

<p>
"Did he know of your driving the powder wagons
through the blazing buildings at Waterloo, when the
regular postilions had deserted their charge?" asked
the señora, with a smile of admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," modestly.  "He was kind enough to speak of
it.  When we left each other, he told me whenever
I return to California to make his house my own.  I
am glad that I met him."
</p>

<p>
A knock shook the door.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Barcelo was outside.
</p>

<p>
"Silvia," he said, "I may say you have shown
yourself to be an unusual woman, a woman of knowledge
and acumen quite remarkable for your years."
</p>

<p>
"Come in and be seated, Crisostimo.  Here is my
friend, Captain Farquharson."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes.  Thank you for the chair.  Good day,
Captain Farquharson," this last stiffly.  "Well, what I
want to decide is, shall I issue a pardon for that
low-down Indian, Stanislaus?  Padre Osuna is now in the
reception room waiting for my answer."
</p>

<p>
"Does the padre wish for this pardon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It's this way.  Padre Osuna has the fellow confined
here in Monterey.  You see," looking at Farquharson,
"I'm still acting-governor, and shall be until notice
accepting my resignation comes back from Mexico City.
So, I can pardon or not, as I please.  Do you
understand?" glowering at the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"But why does the padre ask the pardon?" persisted
the señora.
</p>

<p>
"O, well, he expects to make a good man out of him,
and then through him convert all those savages in the
San Joaquin over whom Stanislaus has become a sort
of king, since the death of Yoscolo."
</p>

<p>
"Surely Padre Osuna's judgment should be trusted in
the matter, Crisostimo."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes.  Exactly what has been in my mind all
the time.  I'll pardon the fellow.  He told me the
Señorita Mendoza has thrashed all the bad spirits out of him,
and that Padre Osuna has beaten many good spirits
into him&mdash;yes, I'll pardon the fellow.  But there is one
thing I never can forget, and that is the way that
rascally Morando has treated me."  He again glared
at Farquharson, left the room and stamped down the
corridor.
</p>

<p>
"It's Crisostimo's way," laughed the señora.  "Captain,
there is the question of the maps in this chamber,
and those wonderful placer mines."
</p>

<p>
"Why not let Twickenham, our consul, take up the
matter?  He is entirely dependable."
</p>

<p>
"Very true, Captain; but there are many inquisitive
eyes about.  The working of the mine would mean that
many may learn of its existence, and soon a deluge of
Americanos come.  Then, surely California would never
be England's.  Let our successors in the work do their
part without undue handicap.  In quieter times we will
form a company, find the mines and work them."
</p>

<p>
"Señora, in Europe your hand will be busy in affairs
of far greater interest to the world than the future of
California."
</p>

<p>
"I shall never forget California, and the maps shall
be safely kept till such time as we wish to use them."
</p>

<p>
"Now, dear lady, after long association comes the
time for good-bys.  It will be months, at least, before we
meet again.  Allow me to express my gratitude for the
inspiration you have been to me in this California
work."
</p>

<p>
"Captain, I thank you most cordially for what you
say.  When Lord Bevis Farquharson, with his wife,
Lady Matilda, and their little daughter, Margaret,
come to London remember that my establishment in
Great Curzon Street is their home."
</p>

<p>
They clasped hands, their eyes dimming.
</p>

<p>
"My lady, do not forget that you have another home
at Farquharson Court."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
<br />
ACROSS THE YEARS
</h3>

<p>
Nine or ten friars, from different missions within a
day's ride, were in a room close by the living
apartment of the pastor, Padre Osuna, of Mission San José.
Once or twice the padre's voice, in deep murmur, came
to the ears of his waiting confreres; then it was silent.
Each time the others paused a little, for his coming,
then resumed desultory conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Why waits so long Padre Osuna for the coming?"
impatiently from Padre Mercado, continuing: "We
are told he is within, and even now once more I heard
his voice."
</p>

<p>
Juan Antonio ushered in Señor Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Señors Padres, it is a delight to meet you.  I trust
your various charges are prospering."
</p>

<p>
The friars, who had arisen, exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"This is as may be, señor," from the padre of Santa
Clara.
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna came quietly into their midst.
</p>

<p>
"Reverend padres, and Señor Mendoza, I am late.
A visitor, coming unexpectedly and bringing a message
of vast purport to me, was the cause of my detaining.
Let us be seated."
</p>

<p>
He continued:
</p>

<p>
"Brethren of my order, I requested you here, that
you might be listeners of the proposal Señor Mendoza
is prepared to make.  You know the missions and their
requirements.  You may be able to enlighten him as
to the wisest course.  Now," inclining his head to
Mendoza, "we are ready to hear you, señor."
</p>

<p>
The courtly hidalgo bowed in return.
</p>

<p>
"Señor pastor, and señors padres, the law of the
secularization is spread on our statute books.  Its
extension in this Mission of San José de Guadalupe has
been gradual, as you know.  I believe the time has come
for further extension."
</p>

<p>
He looked slowly from Osuna to the others.  None of
the churchmen spoke.  He went on:
</p>

<p>
"Namely, that each able-bodied Indian of good character,
member of this Mission, shall receive a plot of
land of sufficient acreage to maintain himself and his
family; the land, of course, to be taken from the
leagues still held by this Mission, in trust, from the
Mexican government."
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna did not speak.
</p>

<p>
"The Indians are but overgrown children, and are
incapable of caring for themselves, except under strict
tutelage.  So said the great missionary, Padre Junipero
Serra, and the years have shown the wisdom of his
thought."  Thus, Padre Suscol, of Sonoma.
</p>

<p>
"Years ago I gave each of my Indians his piece of
land.  They are working it for themselves, and ably.
Padre Junipero spoke of the issue as he knew it sixty
years ago, and most wise were his words, but he could
not foresee present-day needs," was Mendoza's reply.
</p>

<p>
"The procedure that you propose will impoverish the
Mission," remonstrated another friar.
</p>

<p>
"Many of the hacenderos are giving each year a
tithe to the Mission.  Let the Indians be instructed to
do the same, either in money or in labor," rejoined
Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
Osuna lifted his eyes.  "Why load this burden on our
neophytes?"
</p>

<p>
"To teach them the necessity of self-reliance.  They
should become of age, as regards development of
mind."
</p>

<p>
"Their old teachers should determine that," from
Padre Mercado.
</p>

<p>
"The state determines when our sons and daughters
attain their majority, not we," from Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"Why oppress our neophyte children with this
becoming of age just at this time?" questioned Osuna.
</p>

<p>
"Because it is not a day too soon.  Men of many
nations begin to flock here.  Westward the course of
civilization must come.  It is destiny.  We cannot stay
it.  Then, why not meet it?  We, Spaniard and Indian,
must stand on our own feet, accept from the newcomer
what will strengthen our moral and spiritual fiber, and
give back as much of ourselves as will benefit others.
Therefore must we be self-reliant."
</p>

<p>
The room was still.
</p>

<p>
Padre Osuna spoke after a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Circumstances have but now arisen which preclude
me from giving Señor Mendoza reply.  That, as well as
the adjustment of other affairs here, will have to fall to
some one else.  Soon will I make explanation."  Turning
to Mendoza: "Shall I find the Señor Mendoza at
his house late this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Mendoza bowed.  "At your service, señor padre."
</p>

<p>
"Brethren, I will return to you in a moment."
</p>

<p>
The padre conducted the Administrator down a long
corridor, into the courtyard, toward the lodge.
</p>

<p>
An elderly woman was walking under a vine-covered
trellis.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," tenderly from the friar, "I am sorry to
keep you waiting; but there are many things to do,
and only a short time."
</p>

<p>
The snowy-haired woman had advanced a few steps
to meet her son.  She stopped abruptly.  She was not
looking at the padre, but at Señor Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
"My mother, allow me to present to you&mdash;" began the
friar.
</p>

<p>
"The Lady Romalda!" exclaimed Mendoza, the words
clutching his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Don José!" she cried, holding out her hands, her
lips trembling.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza took her hands in his, and, bending
low, reverently kissed the finger-tips.  "Romalda!
Romalda!"
</p>

<p>
The padre looked at the two in questioning wonder.
The woman and the man seemed to have slipped the
years from their shoulders, and to be standing again in
youth.
</p>

<p>
"My boy," said the mother, "Colonel Mendoza and
I knew each other well, many years ago.  We were very
dear&mdash;friends," moisture dimming her eyes, emotion
halting her voice.
</p>

<p>
The son was much shaken by his mother's show of
feeling.  "My beloved mother!" he said, gently stroking
her hair.
</p>

<p>
In a little Señor Mendoza and the Lady Romalda,
after the manner of those long separated, began
speaking of former times.  Soon the padre excused himself,
to return to his brethren, leaving his mother and Señor
Mendoza seated under the trellised vines.
</p>

<p>
Nothing but kindliness and tenderness and chivalry
was in Mendoza's heart for the woman by his side.
Memories long forgotten came to life, under stimulation
of the Lady Romalda's presence.  Robbed of all
harshness were those bygone times.  The happy and
useful life he had spent in his adopted country left
bitterness no room.
</p>

<p>
As for her, slumbering years and crowding vicissitude
had put in the background, but had not quenched,
the affection for her girlhood lover.
</p>

<p>
The years passed under review.
</p>

<p>
They spoke of the parting in the castle of her father,
the Ambassador Altamira, of Castile.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel," she said, a faint blush creeping into her
faded cheek, "had I listened one moment more to you
that day, I would have fled to your arms, and have left
with you for California, though my father's heart had
broken."
</p>

<p>
A surprised exclamation was Mendoza's reply.
</p>

<p>
"You rode furiously down the avenue.  At the bend,
in the shadow of those old oaks, you stopped, reining
your horse about.  I can still see you there.  I hastened
to the door to welcome you, thinking you were about to
return.  My father bade me within, but I obeyed not.
I remained at the door.  I beckoned you.  My father
made a scene.  Nevertheless, once more I beckoned.  I
thought you saw, but you galloped away."
</p>

<p>
"I saw you not.  Grief flooded my eyes.  Castle
Altamira, your home, and hallowed by our courtship, had
been to me as a shrine.
</p>

<p>
"On this Pacific shore I had built another Castle
Altamira, laying the foundation and rearing the walls
in love.  It embodied my devotion to you.  In the shadow
of those oaks, as I rode away, my heart was gone from
me, for the castle in Castile was become but building
stone, the doña of the hearth mine no longer.  The new
home in this western world, lacking the cement of love,
was worthless, and must fall in ruins.  Had I seen you
beckoning&mdash;" agitation breaking the sentence.
</p>

<p>
"You would have returned, José?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Lady Romalda, yes; though many forbidding
ambassador-fathers barred the way," smiling.  "But,
señora, your father's intensity of feeling seemed equaled
by your own."
</p>

<p>
"The hidalgo is by nature an ardent nationalist, as
you know.  Born into that atmosphere, with every breath
I imbibed its spirit.  That you should lose this pride
of nation fired me with indignation.  Yes, José, even
when love forced me to try to bring you back, my very
soul was lifted against you.  Time, and the irony of
fate, revolutionized my views."
</p>

<p>
They became silent, their thoughts busy.
</p>

<p>
"I too became a foreigner," she went on presently,
as if no break had occurred in the conversation.
</p>

<p>
She related her journeying to Bombay with her
father, a few years later, and of meeting there a young
native prince who was in part of Portuguese extraction,
his mother having been a member of a powerful family
of that nationality residing in Goa.
</p>

<p>
The prince's father, a Christian, had been maharajah
of Rajput, one of the great principalities of British
Hindustan.  The Mohammedan portion of the maharajahship
had engendered rebellion.  In attempting
to suppress it by armed force the father was killed.
The son, also a Christian, attained high position in
English officialdom in Bombay.
</p>

<p>
This youthful Hindustanee, whose Latin name was
Lusciano Osuna do Castello Branco, became very
friendly with the daughter of the Spanish
representative, Ambassador Altamira, of Castile.
</p>

<p>
"My father died suddenly," said the Lady Romalda.
"The prince paid court and won my hand.  We were
married.
</p>

<p>
"My husband was a citizen of Great Britain.  I became
a British subject by my marriage.  My son, known
here as Padre Lusciano Osuna, was born in Bombay,
and was given his father's name in baptism, Lusciano
Osuna do Castello Branco."
</p>

<p>
She told of her son's school days in England, whither
the English government had sent him, of his graduation
from a military academy, and his return to India.
</p>

<p>
"The Mohammedan maharajah was deposed by the
British.  My husband was placed on the throne.  I lived
in Rajput, a princess.  My husband fell in suppressing
insurrection, as had his father before him.  Lusciano,
my son, commanded in his father's stead, and through
his efforts the rebellion was overcome.  Great
preparations were under way to honor the young prince, the
present padre, when he should take the throne.  Great
Britain promised him unlimited support.  His father's
enemies, even, swore allegiance to him.  All looked
forward to a reign of prosperity and peace.
</p>

<p>
"Lusciano, always of strongly religious bent, refused
the honor; turned his back on the world and became a
Franciscan novice in Goa.  The people begged him to
remain with the principality, but he persisted in his
chosen course.  Soon he was called to Europe.  In a
few years all Spain was ringing in praise of the brilliant
preaching of the friar do Castello Branco.  His
superiors, foreseeing a future of great usefulness for the
churchman, were about to make him a cardinal.  The
mystic, the recluse, in him took alarm, and he requested
the British ambassador at Madrid to use his influence
to avert the threatened honor.  He was allowed to come
to this province, and hoped the world would forget him.
</p>

<p>
"Grave difficulties have recently arisen in India, which
is seething in rebellion.  The people of Rajput,
remembering his efficient leadership, are clamoring for the
return of Prince do Castello Branco.  The English
premier brought the matter before the pope, who has
issued an order that my son go to Rajput at once,
ascend the throne, and, as friar-king, rule for Christian
concord in the principality.  The British ship bearing
the order to Lusciano stopped at Bombay and I took
passage to meet my son and to see the country which
was to have been my home.
</p>

<p>
"So, José, I came&mdash;and I find you, an unlooked-for
pleasure.  I was told that you had obliterated the house
you had prepared for me, so I thought that long ago
you had left this part of the world forever."
</p>

<p>
Mendoza shook his head slowly, and was lost in
reverie.  At last he spoke.  "My heart overflows with
rejoicing at this privilege of hearing your voice once
more, and of taking your hand in mine.  Time touches
you lightly, Romalda."
</p>

<p>
"And you, also, my Don José, of the erect shoulders
and stalwart form."
</p>

<p>
There under the arbor, with the busy life of the
Mission going on about them, they talked until the
long shades came.
</p>

<p>
It was not until Padre Osuna stood by their side and
said, "Madre mia, the twilight must chill thee after the
warmth of Rajput," that they parted.
</p>

<p>
Matronas attended the mother, while the friar conducted
Mendoza to the lodge gate.
</p>

<p>
"Señor," he said, "I have advised my brethren to
resist secularization by every means within their power.
Were it possible for me to remain as head of this
Mission I would fight, to the last, the proposed
encroachment."
</p>

<p>
The neighboring hacenderos vied among themselves
to do honor to the Princess do Castello Branco, guest
of the province.  The days came and went in delightful
companionship.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the time for the homeward journey had
arrived.  The British ship was sailing out of San
Francisco harbor, on the afternoon tide.
</p>

<p>
Lady Romalda and Señor Mendoza were standing on
the forward deck, looking out over the vast, restless
sea.  She was talking rapidly.  He spoke little.
</p>

<p>
The vessel began pitching on the swells that precede
the bar.
</p>

<p>
It was the moment of parting.
</p>

<p>
They stood, hands clasped.  The lady's eyes were
streaming.  The Administrator's good-by broke in his
voice.
</p>

<p>
A boat was lowered over the side, and Señor Mendoza
was rowed to the fort.
</p>

<p>
The ship gathered headway, crossed the bar, and lost
itself in the horizon of the ocean.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII
<br />
A WEDDING
</h3>

<p>
Merrily rang the chimes in the old belfry of the
Mission church of San José de Guadalupe.
"Come!  Come!  Come!  Come, Come!" the call sounded
far out into the valley shimmering in the green of
springtide.
</p>

<p>
"Come!  Come!  Come!  Come, Come!" echoed the hills.
</p>

<p>
Pigeons, denizens of the church tower, flew in, and
out, and around, the whirring of their wings sounding
above the resonance of the bells, in the intervals of their
summoning notes.  Flocks darted into the air, circled
for a moment, then disappeared, as if bearing away
urgent messages.  Others dropped from emptiness,
clung to the gargoyles on the belfry corners, and, in
low cooings, told some story.
</p>

<p>
"We are coming! coming! coming!" came in refrain
from many footbeats.  Men and women from throughout
the entire province were gathering on the eastern
slope of Santa Clara Valley that bright spring morning.
</p>

<p>
The Vallejos, of the North, came; their ladies were
there, and their sons and their daughters, personifications
of the intellect, the valor, the virtue and the
beauty which glorified the valley of the Moon.  Gold and
silver bespangled their horses' bridles, hung as pendants
from the bridlereins, inlaid the stirrups, and gilded the
saddles from high pommel in the front to long anquera
reaching back to crupper.
</p>

<p>
Gold lace adorned the hatbands and decorated the
ponchos of the men, while gold spurs clicked at their
heels.  Silk and satin embellished señoritas beautiful
and señoras handsome.  Peons and peonas, jigging
after their masters on horses clean-limbed and swift,
were bravely attired as for a fiesta.
</p>

<p>
The Picos rode in from the South, with retinue as
splendid as that of their Sonoma rivals, their Gallic
heritage showing in the harmony and luxuriousness of
color in poncho and gowning.
</p>

<p>
José Antonio Carillo escorted representatives of his
family along the Camino Real, through San José
pueblo, on to San José Mission, four leagues away
toward the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
The Bandinis followed the de la Guerras.  The
Auguellos and the Malarins paced side by side.  The busy
bee of politics buzzed in vain in the cap of Juan de
Bautista Alvarado, for the active brain beneath was
under the spell of superior attraction in Mission San
José, and the man hastened thither faster than if the
governor's chair awaited him there.
</p>

<p>
Señor Castro, the steadfast, flanked his friend Señor
Alvarado, and looked about complacently, contentment
complete, since his equipment equaled any present.
</p>

<p>
The "Bostons," allied to the Spanish families, were
there, as Latin in dress and manner as the Spaniards
themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Come!  Come!  Come, Come!" the bell kept saying.
"Come, to the nuptials of the Señorita Carmelita
Mendoza and the Señor Alfredo Morando."
</p>

<p>
Mission San José lay nestling in verdure.  The vineyards
pointed their budding tendrils low, their gentler
tints soft against the darker leaves of the olive groves.
</p>

<p>
Orange orchards rioted in magnificence on the sunny
slopes.  The tree foliage, shot through with the waxy
petals of next year's promise, half hid the golden balls
of this year's harvest still awaiting the gathering hand.
</p>

<p>
Almond trees, as yet showing never a leaf, were
beclouded by their snowy flowerings into vast pillars.
</p>

<p>
Gentle breezes rose and fell.  Soft blossom-showers
whitened the ground, eddied around parent tree-trunk,
or crept to modest hiding place amidst the grass-blades.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere the odor of growing things loaded the
air with sweet messages.  Myriad flower-breaths floated
through open doors and windows, dropping fragrant
tribute in hacienda house and cloistered corridor.
</p>

<p>
People in throngs, eager with expectancy, held the
street fronting on the Mendoza hacienda house.
Masters of ceremony opened a wide lane from mansion to
church.  The Spanish gentry fringed either side;
detachments of soldiers, in serried rank, stood next; back
of them, overflowing to the very limits of the village,
crowded other residents of the valley.
</p>

<p>
The deep-throated organ within the church began to
voice its monologue.  The conversation of hidalgos fell
to whisper; the chatter of peons and peonas hushed.
</p>

<p>
The great gate of the courtyard swung open wide.
Through the archway, on a palfrey white as milk, came
the daughter of the de la Mendoza.  Her mount, true
to the strain of his forebears in far-away Arabia,
caracoled to and fro, and ambled forward slowly, step by
step, as if to show the perfection that California could
breed in priceless horseflesh.  His mane flowed into the
trappings on his breast; his streaming tail almost
touched the ground.
</p>

<p>
Carmelita, gowned in white, rode stately, as became
the princess that she well might be.  The wreath of
orange bloom clinging above her forehead would have
made a fitting diadem.  The folds of her bridal robe
fell entrancingly about her.  With eyes cast down,
cheeks aglow, she passed along, the fairest bride Santa
Clara Valley ever saw; no small claim, indeed, for hers
was a time and she of a race wherefrom beautiful
women sprang in plenty.
</p>

<p>
Here bridesmaids followed in double file, their horses
white, every one; their apparel, the delicate pink of the
first flush of dawn, the result of skillful needlewomen
through many a day.
</p>

<p>
Lolita Hernandez, pretty and piquant, was side by
side with Lucinda Higuera, demure and handsome.
Alfreda Castro, with raven hair showing beneath her satin
head-covering, moved along with Tula Laynez, gray-eyed,
blonde-cheeked, and saucy as a sparrow.  Palmita
Peralta, with cherry lips ever smiling, was paired with
Leopolda Estudillo, of the starry eyes.
</p>

<p>
The bride has reached the church steps.
</p>

<p>
Deftly her feet disengage themselves from the silken
loops used for stirrup; nimbly she reaches ground.
Quickly the following señoritas are at her side, while
peon grooms lead away the horses.
</p>

<p>
"Viva!  Viva!  The Señorita Mendoza!  Viva!  Viva!"
</p>

<p>
Then from some one: "Viva! the Señorita doña's
bridesmaids!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Ah!  Look!" cried many.
</p>

<p>
Morando, on coal-black steed, came through the gate
and slowly to the church door.  Comandante of all
California he was now, promotion from guardian of pueblo
San José to post commander at Yerba Buena having
been succeeded by transfer to Monterey presidio; and,
finally, came the command of all the land forces.
</p>

<p>
With him rode, as groomsmen, the presidio
commanders of Yerba Buena, of Monterey, of Santa
Barbara, and of San Diego, and accompanied by many
caballeros.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza, now Governor Mendoza, was horsed
on old Mercurio falling into years, still peerless for
speed in all the valley.  Flanked by members of his
council and the junta departmental the Governor made
his way up to the church.  With sweeping gesture of his
bridle-rein, to the right and to the left, he gave salute
for salute to the waiting grandees, as he passed along.
</p>

<p>
Up the aisle, decorated with innumerable Castilian
roses intertwined with ivy, came Carmelita, on her
father's arm, orange blossoms clustered in her hand,
her bridesmaids well in the lead.
</p>

<p>
The organ swelled in notes of rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
Directly before the señorita went two little girls,
clad in white, backing slowly altarward, as she
advanced.  Freshly gathered rose-petals, handful by
handful, they showered before her, making a pathway
sweetly yielding as she trod.
</p>

<p>
Captain Morando, awaiting his bride, stood at the
altar gate, in uniform, his poncho laid aside, his brother
officers attending him.
</p>

<p>
Bride and groom knelt within the sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
Neophyte Indian acolytes swung censers.  Incense
hung in the air, tingling the nostrils with its Oriental
perfume, while the many candles glowed through the
maze like burnished spear-points.
</p>

<p>
As the clergy solemnly intoned the nuptial service,
the choir, a hundred strong, of Indian men and women
touchingly gave back its responses.  The melody of
Pepita's voice flooded nave and chancel, love for her
mistress the inspiration.
</p>

<p>
An instant's pause.  Every breath stilled.
</p>

<p>
With hands upraised over bride and groom stood the
officiating padre.  "Whom, therefore, God hath joined
together let no man put asunder."
</p>

<p>
Down the aisle husband and wife led bridesmaid and
groomsman, governor, council, and junta departmental.
</p>

<p>
Muskets crashed, as they crossed the street; the
multitude shouted congratulations; the hills above them
lived in medley of reiterated acclaimings of good will.
</p>

<p>
At the wedding breakfast words dripped like honey
from the mouth of Señor Alvarado, as he spoke of the
lovely bride.  Grave Castro smiled approbation; the
clever Carillo applauded; his ally, Don Pio Pico, cried
aloud, "Bon!  Bon!  Buena!"  Even Alvarado's saturnine
enemy, the half-Sicilian, Di Vestro, clapped his hands,
as the señor, the honey-drip becoming torrential
eloquence, said: "For the kiss of such a bride as the
Señora Morando, gladly would I again drive that Mexican
usurper, Micheltorena, from California soil; yes,
and every follower he has!"
</p>

<p>
"Will you!  Will you!" exclaimed the young wife,
blushing at mention of the new name.  Stepping up, she
kissed squarely the Señor Alvarado, her mother's
brother.
</p>

<p>
"A challenge!  A challenge!" from the guests.  "The
former governor at last has found a nut he cannot
crack.  Aha!  Alvarado, thy kinswoman is ever quicker
in retort than thou."
</p>

<p>
The tall politician bowed gently to the Señora Doña
Carmelita.
</p>

<p>
"If you draw them hither, mi querida, no power of
mine could budge them a single inch."
</p>

<p>
"Well said!  Well said!"
</p>

<p>
Later came the afternoon barbecue in the foothills.
Dozens of beeves were roasting in deep pits, on
live-coals, the outdoor sports of early California first
whetting the appetite for the feast.
</p>

<p>
Bonfire blazed red against crag and forest that night,
as peon and peona continued the repast, and danced
the fandango to the music of guitar, and the surprised
cries of catamount and wolf.
</p>

<p>
At the hacienda house the Señor and Señora Morando
danced in the contra danza amidst the plaudits of the
lookers-on.
</p>

<p>
Señor Mendoza, threescore and ten and one, led
forth the lithe Francesca Sanchez, and never youth
tripped a lighter step than did the governor of
California at his daughter's wedding.
</p>

<p>
Pio Pico, gallant and graceful, placed his hat on a
señorita's head, and they followed Mendoza and his
partner.
</p>

<p>
Alvarado and Castro, Pedro Zelaya and Abelardo
Peralta found ladies and joined; so did de la Barra, and
Higuera, Salvador Vallejo and Nazario Dominguez,
until, as some said, California north, and south, and
center, was united, if only for the contra danza.
</p>

<p>
Small hours found the gaiety undiminished, for midnight
supper strengthened for further dancing.  Neither
was one day deemed sufficient to do adequate honor to
the marriage of Carmelita Mendoza and Comandante
Morando.
</p>

<p>
Next day the couple, the Governor Mendoza, and all
friends repaired to the hacienda house of Fulgencio
Higuera, two leagues away, to dance and to make merry
till the break of another morning.
</p>

<p>
The third day was passed with Señor Berryessa, near
pueblo San José, the following at Marco Calderon's,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
The seventh day found them entering the porte cochere
of their own home, once the residence of Colonel
Barcelo, from whose gates, ere many moons, they were
to see, with rejoicing hearts, the Stars and Stripes
burst, in unending vigil, over government house, plaza
and castle.
</p>

<p>
Long years, and happy ones, they lived, and their
descendants, now of the third and fourth generation,
bless their memory, and tell of the honor, the bravery,
the virtue of General Morando and his bride of Mission
San José.
